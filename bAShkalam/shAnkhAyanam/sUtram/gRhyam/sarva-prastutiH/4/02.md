5 [^3] . No inviting (takes place here), nor the putting (of food) into the fire, nor (do) the Viśve devās (take part in this ceremony). 'Relished?' - thus are they to be asked whether they are satiated. 'May it approach (the fathers),' instead of 'imperishable.'


[^3]:  'Because the āvāhana (inviting) is forbidden here, it follows p. 109 that it must take place at the Pārvaṇa Śrāddha' (Nār.). According to Rāmacandra's Paddhati he shall say to the Brāhmaṇas, 'I will invite hither the fathers;' and when they give their consent, he invites them with Rig-veda X, 16, 12. Comp. Yājñavalkya I, 232 seq., &c. Regarding the Viśve devās comp. the note on chap. 1, 2; as to the tṛptapraśna (the question whether they are satiated) comp. Manu III, 251; Yājñ. I, 240. At the Pārvaṇa Śrāddha, after the Brāhmaṇas have finished their dinner and rinsed their mouths, and after the Piṇḍas have been offered, the sacrificer says, 'May what has been given at this Śrāddha to our father N.N., who belongs to the gotra N.N., be imperishable!' (comp. Yājñ. I, 242.) This phrase is to be altered at the Ekoddiṣṭa Śrāddha in the way indicated in this Sūtra.

8 [^4] . And (then) omission of the fourth one.


[^4]:  After the Ekoddiṣṭa Śrāddha has been performed for a dead person during the first year after his death, he is to be admitted, by the Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa ceremony, among the other Manes, and receives thenceforward his Piṇḍa together with them at the ordinary Pārvaṇa Śrāddha. As the ritual of this Śrāddha requires that the number of the 'fathers' worshipped should be three, the accession of a new person makes necessary the omission of the pra-pra-pitāmaha, who has now become fourth among the fathers.
