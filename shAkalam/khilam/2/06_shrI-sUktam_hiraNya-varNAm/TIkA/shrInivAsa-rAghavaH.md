SRI SUKTA. 
The 
[Sri Sukta is a hymn of fifteen verses in praise of the Goddess Sri or Lakshmi and is a 'Khila Rik' (supplemental hymn) of the Rig Veda. first two are addressed to Jatavedah (Narayana) and request him to bring Sri to the devotee. The third and the fourth are invocations to Sri herself and by the fifth, the devotee does the 'Prapatti.' By the next five, he prays for the removal of all evil and ignorance, and for the gift of learning and wealth and fame. The next two request the father and attendant of Sri to make Her dwell in his house. The last three are, as in the opening verses, addressed to Jata- vedah requesting him to bring Lakshmi to him.]
