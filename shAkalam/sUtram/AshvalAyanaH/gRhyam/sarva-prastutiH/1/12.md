1 [^1] . At a Caitya sacrifice he should before the Sviṣṭakṛt (offering) offer a Bali to the Caitya.

[^1]:  12, 1. There seems to be no doubt that Professor Stenzler is right in giving to caitya in this chapter its ordinary meaning of religious shrine ('Denkmal'). The text shows that the Kaitya sacrifice was not offered like other sacrifices at the sacrificer's home, but that in some cases the offering would have to be sent, at least symbolically, to distant places. This confirms Professor Stenzler's translation of caitya. Nārāyaṇa explains caitya by citte bhava, and says, 'If he makes a vow to a certain deity, saying, "If I obtain such and such a desire, I shall offer to thee an Ājya sacrifice, or a Sthālīpāka, or an animal" - and if he then obtains what he had wished for and 'performs that sacrifice to that deity: this is a caitya sacrifice.' I do not know anything that supports this statement as to the meaning of caitya.

2 [^2] . If, however, (the Caitya) is distant, (he should send his Bali) through a leaf-messenger.

[^2]:  'He should make of a leaf a messenger and a carrying-pole.' Nārāyaṇa.

3 [^3] . With the Ṛc, 'Where thou knowest, O tree' (Rig-veda V, 5, 10), let him make two lumps (of food), put them on a carrying-pole, hand them over to the messenger, and say to him, 'Carry this Bali to that (Caitya).'

[^3]:  Comp. Pāraskara III, 11, 10.

4. (He gives him the lump) which is destined for the messenger, with (the words), 'This to thee.'
