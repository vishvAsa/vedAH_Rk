      <description>&lt;p&gt;ĀSVALĀYANA-GRIHYA-SŪTRA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TO THE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ĀSVALĀYANA-GRIHYA-SŪTRA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MOST of the questions referring to the Gr̥hya-sūtra of Āśvalāyana will be treated of more conveniently in connection with the different subjects which we shall have to discuss in our General Introduction to the Gr̥hya-sūtras. Here I wish only to call attention to a well-known passage of Shaḍguruśishya, in which that commentator gives some statements on the works composed by Āśvalāyana and by his teacher Saunaka. As an important point in that passage has, as far as I can see, been misunderstood by several eminent scholars, I may perhaps be allowed here to try and correct that misunderstanding, though the point stands in a less direct connection with the Gr̥hya-sūtra than with another side of the literary activity of Āśvalāyana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
