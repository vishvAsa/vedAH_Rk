There is general consensus (Geldner, Renou, Klein loc. cit.) that Indra is the subject of both of these vss., with Pūṣan appearing only as the instr. companion in 2b. By contrast, I consider Pūṣan the “best charioteer” (rathī́tamaḥ in 2a and 3c), because in the immediately preceding hymn rathī́- (VI.55.1c), rathī́tama- (VI.55.2a) are unequivocally used of Pūṣan. My interpr. requires that the subject change from 2a to 2bc, where Indra is indeed the subject, but see the anyáḥ … anyáḥ construction in the next hymn (VI.57.2, cf. 3) where the two gods each appear contrastively in the nominative. This interpr. also has the advantage that Pūṣan doesn’t disappear in the middle of his own hymn.
