<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

As noted in the published introduction, I consider the remaining vss. to belong to a different hymn (or hymns?), appended to the unified, well-structured hymn found in vss. 1-12. Vss. 13-15 are unified by their meter, including an unusual variant of Uṣṇih with the configuration 8 8 / 8 4; see disc. ad vs. 13. Whether vs. 16, in Anuṣṭubh, belongs to this set or was independently appended I don’t know, but it certainly has a “final” feel to it.
