Here the power of soma to rouse Indra to beneficial action is the general subject of the tṛca. The three forms belonging to √pā ‘drink’ in the 1st hemistich, pā́tram ‘drinking cup’, indrapā́nam ‘giving drink to Indra’, and apāyi ‘has been drunk’, in echoing the first word of the preceding vs. (15a pā́tā ‘drinker’), may have caused this tṛca to be grafted onto the last.
