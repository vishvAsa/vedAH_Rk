On the meter of this tṛca see Oldenberg, Proleg. 91 and Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition metrical comm. The fading in and out between Virāj and Triṣṭubh is further complicated by the openings of 3 in 11-syllable lines in 7b, c.

The tṛca concerns soma and contains lexical and thematic responsions.
