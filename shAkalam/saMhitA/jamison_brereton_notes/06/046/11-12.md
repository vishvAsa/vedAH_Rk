<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

This pragātha shows both internal and external connections. As in the previous pragātha the 2nd vs. is syntactically dependent on the first, with the yátra clause of 12ab parallel to the yád clause of 11cd and both subordinate to the imperatival clause of 11b. In addition the first and last hemistichs (11ab, 12cd) open identically, with ádha smā, which echoes ádha smā of the last hemistich of the previous pragātha (10cd).

On the particular connection of vs. 12 with vs. 9 see immed. below.
