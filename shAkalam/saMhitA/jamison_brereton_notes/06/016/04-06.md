<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

As noted in the published introduction, each vs. in this tṛca begins with a form of the 2nd sg. prn., although all three are slightly different: the acc. sg. t(u)vā́ m in 4a shows distraction; both 5a and 6a contain the nom. sg., but the 1st is undistracted, the 2nd distracted.
