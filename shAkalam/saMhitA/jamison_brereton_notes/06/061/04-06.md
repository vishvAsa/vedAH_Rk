<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

This tṛca is almost empty of content, in part because so much of each Gāyatrī — not a capacious meter in the first place — is occupied by repeated material: the last 6 of the 8 syllables of the 1st pāda of each vs. contain the nom. (4) or voc. (5, 6) of the NP devī́sárasvatī, and the b pādas of 4 and 6 contain responsive material: vā́jebhiḥ vājínīvatī (4) and x x vā́jeṣu vājini. Otherwise, as a helper (avitrī́) she is twice asked to help (4c avatu, 6b ávā). In the published translation these two impvs. are rendered in two different ways: “Let … help” and “aid” respectively. I would now change the 2nd to “help” as well to mark their essential identity (save for ps.). [Note that the Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition restoration of avitry àvatu in 4c is wrong: correct their avitrí to avitrī́.]
