These two vss. are contrastively paired: each has a generalizing rel. clause describing the activities of a mortal -- harmful in 4ab, beneficial in 5ab -- while the 2nd hemistichs of each set out the results of such actions. The pairing is further emphasized by the phonological similarities of the oppositional verbs abhidā́sat ‘will assail’ (4a) and dádāśat (5b) ‘will ritually serve’.
