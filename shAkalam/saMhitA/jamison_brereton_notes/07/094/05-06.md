Both vss. begin with the dual pronoun tā́, but the first is 3rd ps. (“these two”) and object of a 3rd ps. verb (īḷate … víprāsaḥ “the inspired poets invoke those two”), while the 2nd, followed by 2nd ps. enclitic vām, has switched reference to 2nd ps.

and is object of a 1st ps. verb (havāmahe “we call upon you two”) -- thus effecting a relationship of considerably more intimacy.
