These last two vss. concern the vājínaḥ ‘prize-winners’. As indicated in the published introduction, although most (in addition to the usual tr., see Oberlies RdV II.240) take these to be horses, as so often, I instead take the referent of vājín- to be the Maruts. In an All God hymn the default expectation is that gods are the dedicands.

And there are numerous phraseological parallels that support the identification. See esp. nearby VII.36.7, where the Maruts are called vājínaḥ, as well as in the immediately preceding hymn, where VII.35.9 śáṃ no bhavantu marútaḥ svarkā́ḥ is almost identical, save for the expressed subj., to our 7ab śáṃ no bhavantu vājínaḥ … svarkā́ḥ. The stem svarká- occurs only 3 times; besides these two occurrences, the third, in I.88.1, refers to the Maruts’ chariots. The voc. phrase amṛtā ṛtājāḥ in our 8b is found also, addressed to the Maruts, in V.57.8 ámṛtā ṛ́tājāḥ (accented).
