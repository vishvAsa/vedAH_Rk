There is no main clause in vs. 3: the three co-referential participial phrases (… ichámānāḥ b, … nákṣamānāḥ c, … jóhuvataḥ …d) all simply expanding on the dependent cl. of pāda a, úpo ha yád … gúḥ “When they have come”).

However, the first pāda of vs. 4 echoes 3b exactly, save for number: 3b … víprāḥ prámatim ichámānāḥ (pl.) versus 4a … vípraḥ prámatim ichámānaḥ (sg.), vs. 4 seems to continue vs. 3. Interestingly enough, it is not possible to determine whether his new start in 4 is a main clause or continues the dependent cl. in vs. 3 -- though Geldner, Renou, and I all take it as an independent cl. The problem is that the finite verb ī́ṭṭe opens the second pāda; its accent then can be owing to its metrical position and it can be a main-cl. verb (as we all interpret it). However, the accent could also signal that it’s the verb of a dependent cl., and the whole complex of vss. 34 could be interpr.

“When the prize seekers have come …., (when) the inspired poet … invokes …, (then,) o Indra and Agni, further us …” -- in other words 4cd would supply the main cl. for all of 3-4ab.
