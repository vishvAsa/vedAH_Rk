<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

As noted in the published introduction, vss. 3 and 4 are responsive. The first pāda of 4 concentrates the essence of the 1st two pādas of 3, substituting ví cakrame (of 3b) for trír deváḥ (in 3a) at the beginning of the pāda. This phrase, trír deváḥ, is short a syllable; Oldenberg suggests reading t·rir, but this seems unlikely: I don’t know of any other disyllabic readings of this extremely common numeral (either as 1st cmpd member tri- or adverbial trís). I suggest rather that the metrically disturbed opening draws attention to the beginning of this set of paired vss. by being flawed and is “repaired” by 4a. See similar remarks about 3c and 5c ad vs. 5.
