The 1st two vss. of this hymn begin with prá, recalling the insistent prá in the 1st vs. of the preceding hymn (VII.42.1) and presumably fulfilling the same function: to express the energetic initiation of the ritual. However, both prá √ṛc (1a) and prá √i (2a) are standard lexemes, unlike those in 42.1.
