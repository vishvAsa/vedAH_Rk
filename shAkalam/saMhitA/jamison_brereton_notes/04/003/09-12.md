<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

Each of these vss. begins with the resonant and charged instr. ṛténa ‘by truth’, the usual introduction to a truth formulation. Each of the vss. does seem to express a mystical truth about the ritual or its mythic background. There is no obvious connection to the group of vss. that precede (the question vss. of 4cd-8), but if I am correct that we should supply ‘thought’ or ‘thoughts’ in 8cd, where we ask Agni to send them all the way to heaven, it may not be fanciful to think that vss. 9-12 are these very thoughts.
