<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

These two vss. revisit the utá sma opening that characterized the middle vss. of IV.38.

There is also a concentration of intensives: 3d táritrataḥ, 4c saṃtā́vīt u vat, 4d āpaniphaṇat -- appropriate to the ever-increasing speed and the intense repetitive movements of the horse racing to the finish line.
