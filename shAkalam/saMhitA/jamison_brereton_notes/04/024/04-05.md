The pile-up of pāda-initial ā́d íd ‘just then, just after that’, beginning with 4d and marking every pāda in 5, conveys the quick succession of events, but switches abruptly from battlefield to sacrifice. The néme constructions of 4d and 5a make it clear, however, that despite the change in venue the same antagonists are in play.

Note also the similarity of the predicates of the two néme constructions: indrayante … indriyáṃ yajante. This is the only occurrence of the denom. indraya- in the RV and it may have been created to serve as a foil for the second VP.
