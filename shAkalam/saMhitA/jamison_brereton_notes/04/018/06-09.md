<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

For my interpr. of the speakers in these vss. and the role of the waters in the myth, see published introduction. Most tr. take the vss. as all spoken by Indra’s mother (Geldner [/Witzel Gotō], Doniger), whereas I distribute them to a variety of voices: 6 Indra, 7 Indra’s mother, 8 waters, 9 Indra’s mother. As I see it, in 6 Indra prompts his mother to ask the waters questions; in 7 she rather sarcastically and belittlingly asks questions about them, whom she seems to accuse of trying to lay claim to her son. They respond directly to him in 8, reminding him of his mother’s dereliction of maternal duty and suggesting that they are better at mothering him than she is. So that she rather defiantly points out in 9 that subsequent negative things that happened to him were not her fault.
