All three vss. of this tṛca begin with yátra. I take them all as subordinated to vs. 3. Geldner [/Witzel Gotō] and Klein (DGRV I.432) take the main clause for all three vss. to be 6c, but Indra’s help for Etaśa does not seem sufficiently significant to carry the whole tṛca. Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) take all three yátra as ‘where’, not ‘when’, but what location they are thinking of I don’t know.

I do not know what to do with the utá’s in yátrotá in 4 and 6, but assume they are there to indicate the additive nature of the sequence of subordinate clauses. Sim.

Klein (DGRV I.431-32). It would be better if the first one were in vs. 5, not vs. 4.
