As discussed in the published introduction, the next few vss. are very challenging; they have received multiple interpretations, which can’t be discussed in detail here.

The vss. form a unity based on their shared vocab. (e.g., góhe 6b, 7c, 8c; auśijásya 6b, 7c), their shared syntactic formulae (yád *ī 6a, yád īm 7a, 7c, and yád ī 8d), and their shared metrical irregularity.
