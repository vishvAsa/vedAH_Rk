Though vs. 6 belongs metrically and syntactically with what precedes -- it is in Anuṣṭubh like vss. 2-5 and the accusative descriptive phrases hang off vs. 5 -- it belongs thematically with vs. 7, as noted in the published introduction. Both vss. treat the mystery of the ritual fire, and being at the center of the hymn, they form a sort of omphalos.
