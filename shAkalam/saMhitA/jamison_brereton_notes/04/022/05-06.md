<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

These vss. summarizing Indra’s great deeds begin identically: tā́tū́te [ta in sandhi before vowel in 6]. The vss. appear at the exact center of the hymn and thus may count as an omphalos. Although both pādas have Indra’s deeds as subject, neither has a word for ‘deed’.
