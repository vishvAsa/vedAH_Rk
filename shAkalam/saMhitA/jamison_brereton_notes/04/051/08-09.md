The unbroken similarity of the dawns who just keep coming, day after day, is conveyed by the stasis of these two vss., where forms of ‘same’ (8ab samanā́ … sanānátaḥ samanyā́, 9a samanā́samānī́ḥ) and the same verb caranti (8a, 9b) bring all movement to a halt, even though the dawns are constantly on the move.
