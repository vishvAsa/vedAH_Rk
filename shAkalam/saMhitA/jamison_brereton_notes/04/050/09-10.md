<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

This last section consisting of two vss. introduces Indra by name for the first time in the hymn. The two divine figures are carefully balanced, as the address to them shows: vs. 10 opens with the name Indra in a reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction, índraś ca … bṛhaspate, while two independent vocatives open vs. 11, this time with Bṛhaspati first: bṛhaspata indra.
