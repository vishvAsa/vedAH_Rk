These two vss. provide a double ending to this hymn. The first (20) begins, as summary vss. often do, with evá ‘just in this way’. It announces selfreferentially, with the root aor. akarma “we have just made,” that the hymn being completed is the bráhman- we have created for Indra. And, as noted above ad vs. 18, the purpose clauses with subjunctive provide reassurance for the worried questions in 18ab. Vs. 21 is repeated as the final verse of the seven hymns IV.17, 19-24, so it serves as a refrain vs. for (some of) the Vāmadeva Indra hymns. It also announces, with a root aor. (though aor. passive), that the formulation has just been made (ákāri … bráhma). Despite the apparent duplication, we should not necessarily assume that this refrain was tacked onto an already complete hymn, because gṛṇānáḥ at the end of 21a may form a ring with the same word at the end of vs. 1.
