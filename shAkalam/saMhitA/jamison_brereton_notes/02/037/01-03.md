<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

The d pādas of the first three vss. have a rigid structure: PRIEST’S CUP sómaṃ draviṇodaḥ píbartúbhiḥ. Noteworthy is only that píba is accented in all three vss., though there is no obvious reason for this, and the last three vss. (4-6), which also contain imperatives to √pā, though of different form (4d pibatu, 5d pibatam, 6d pāyayā), in syntactically variant constructions, lack such accent. I have no explanation (and it seems not to have attracted any attention) beyond the suggestion that píbartúbhiḥ is treated as a detachable refrain, even though what precedes it in the pāda must be construed with it. See now also remarks ad III.32.1.
