The d pādas of these two vss. apparently begin with the same verb: 1d pātám, 2d ní pātam, but these two almost certainly belong to the two homonymous roots √pā ‘drink’ and √pā ‘protect’ respectively, pace Geldner Renou’s arg. that the latter belongs to ‘protect’ seems pretty decisive: ni √pā ‘drink’ is not found till the Rām., whereas ní √pā ‘protect’ is quite well attested in the RV. I imagine the poet signaled the change of root by including this preverb while enjoying the etymological play (see also píbatam beginning 2a, 4a, as well as pātam 5d).
