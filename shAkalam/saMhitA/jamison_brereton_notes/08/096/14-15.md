Both Lüders (Var. 20, 506) and Schlerath (Kö. 139) consider this sequence to be a satyakriya. I can see the point, but if it is a truth-formulation, it is a muted one. The concept is clearest in 15a “Let this truth be protective of me,” esp. since this is the last verse of the hymn. The truth-formulation itself could be either the preceding verse (so Lüders) or the whole hymn (Schlerath allows both possibilities). In the absence of the standard instrumental ṛtéṇa (later satyena) that signals a satyakriya I am reluctant to label it as such, though certainly it is akin.

Schlerath also point out that the last word of the hymn is rājan.
