A verb needs to be supplied with the d pādas of this tṛca (sómaṃ sunvató aśvinā). On both general grounds and the d pādas of vss. 1-3 (sómam pibatam aśvinā)(see also 22b píbatam somyám mádhu), ‘drink’ makes the most sense, though ‘drive to’, which dominates the middle part of the hymn, is certainly possible.
