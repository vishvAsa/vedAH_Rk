<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

This pragātha is tightly bound lexically. Note first víśvāḥ spṛ́dhaḥ in both 5a and 6c. But more striking are the six occurrences of the root √tari : prátūrtiṣu (5a), (viśva-)tū́r (5c), tūrya taruṣyataḥ (5d), turáyantam (6a), tūrvasi (6d). In this group not a single stem is repeated: there are two different nominal stems and four different verbal stems. (See also átūrtam in 7d, to yet another stem.) On the formulaic use of this root and its Indo-European background, see Watkins, Dragon 344-46.
