The linkage of tṛcas is unusually close here, with the pāda-length refrain of vss. 25-27 recast as the first hemistich of vs. 28 and ā́d ít te, which opened the refrain of 25-27, retained as the opening of the refrain of 28-30.

For the only time in the hymn the Anhang is only three syllables, yemire, but this deviation is probably a word play. Oldenberg rejects Geldner’s older suggestion that we should read ní yemire as the refrain on the basis of niyemiré in 28b, but although Oldenberg is probably correct that we should not change the text by accenting ní, I think he was too hasty in dismissing the idea out of hand. The refrain ā́d ít te víśvā bhúvanāni yemire temptingly juxtaposes the final syllable of the neut. pl. bhúvanāni and the verb yemire, and of course bhúvanā without its -ni would be a fine neut. plural as well. The audience is surely being invited to consider alternative segmentations.

The phonetic figure noted in VIII.6.36 dominates the next four verses: haryatā́hárī.
