The verbal form that constitutes the refrain, vavákṣitha ‘you have waxed strong’, is accented. Oldenberg plausibly attributes the accent to its position as a semiindependent refrain (Anhang), so that it is not necessary either to supply a subordinator or to take the verb as an independent clause. Geldner, by contrast, supplies a subordinator, flg. Sāy (see Geldner n.).
