With Kümmel (181-82), I assign the curious paired reduplicated med. opt.

forms (ā́…) cucyavīrata (8) and ācucyuvīmáhi (9) to the caus. reduplicated aorist, which is otherwise only active. I have no explanation for the difference in the grade of the root syllable (-cyav- vs. -cyuv-); no morphological or metrical factors can explain the variation between these two almost adjacent forms. Possibly the 3rd pl.

has full grade in some kind of imitation of the full grade of act. 3rd pl. imperfects to redupl. presents (type ájuhavur vs. ájuhuma), but that is found only in the active voice and not in the optative, so it would be a bizarre and tenuous imitation indeed.
