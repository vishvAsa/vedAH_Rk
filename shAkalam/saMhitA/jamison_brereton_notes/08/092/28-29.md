Geldner tr. rā́dhya- as “leicht zu gewinnen,” but I take it rather as “to be realized, brought to success.” What the content of Indra’s thought is may be clarified by V.39.3 yát te ditsú prarā́dhyam mánaḥ ... “your thought ... which is eager to give, should be realized.” The giving theme is made explicit in the next verse. His intention (the mánas- of 28c) is to give, and this intention will be realized, because giving (rātí-, 29a) has been ordained as part of his nature. Then 29c reaffirms the ritual partnership of mutual giving between Indra and his worshipers. I consider Geldner’s “und doch (bist du), Indra, bei mir” not sufficiently specific, esp. given the strong assertion of connection between us and Indra in the tvā́yujā́(31c), tváyéd … yujā́ (32c) “with you as yokemate” found in following verses, not to mention 32c tvám asmā́kaṃ táva smasi “You are ours; we are yours.”
