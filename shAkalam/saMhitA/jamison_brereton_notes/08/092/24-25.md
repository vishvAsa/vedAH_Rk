<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

On kukṣí- as originally ‘cheek’, not ‘belly’, see Jamison 1987; also for the pun on dhā́man- ‘foundation’, hence ‘fundament’, that is, ‘buttocks, bottom’, in vs. 24, but, in vs. 25, ‘foundation, establishment’ in the sense of ‘bestowal’; also the jocular name Śrutakakṣa in 25.
