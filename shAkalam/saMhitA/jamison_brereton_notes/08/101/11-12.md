As noted in the published introduction, the banality of these vss. is a surprising aberration in RVic style. I will note that pāda-final mahā́m̐asi “you are great,” found 5x in these two vss. (once mid-pāda), is something of a signature of the late VIIIth Maṇḍala (60.6, 19; 64.2, 95.4, 98.2), though it's found occasionally elsewhere.
