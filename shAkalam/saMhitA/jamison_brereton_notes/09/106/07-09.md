<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

Because of the distribution of word boundaries, the first two vss. of this tṛca make a separate 4-syllable pāda impossible (7 … soma naḥ sadaḥ; 8 … amṛ̥́tāya kám papuḥ), though vs. 9 ends with the signature svarvídaḥ. Therefore this must be the 8 8 / 12 Uṣṇih variety. No striking thematic unity.
