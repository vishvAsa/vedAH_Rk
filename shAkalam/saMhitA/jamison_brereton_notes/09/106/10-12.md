<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

In all cases it’s possible to detach the last four syllables, but Oldenberg considers this tṛca to belong with those in which those syllables are integrated into a Jagatī line. As for thematic unity, all three vss. concern Soma’s journey (but then what vss. do not?), and the 1st two mention the sheep’s fleece filter. All three also concern the role of the verbal portion of the ritual and Soma’s relation to it: he is “at the forefront of speech” (ágre vācáḥ) in 10c and begets speech (vā́caṃ janáyan) in 12c, while insights (dhī-) are used to impel him in 11a and thoughts (matí-) sound towards him in 11c.
