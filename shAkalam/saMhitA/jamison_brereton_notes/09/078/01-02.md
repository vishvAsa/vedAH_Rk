The opening of this vs. prá ṇo dhanvantv índavaḥ … echoes that of vs. 1 X no dhanvantv índavaḥ, prá but with the preverb in tmesis relocated to a more standard, pre-verbal position.

Although (a)codásaḥ (1a) and (mada-)cyútaḥ (2a) obviously belong to different roots (√cud, √cyut), they have similar semantics, ‘impel, urge on’ and ‘arouse, set in motion’, and similar phonology. So the negated acodás- ‘without impulsion, without being impelled’ and positive mada-cyút- ‘arousing exhilaration’ (by my interpr., but see below) function as a virtual polarized pair, describing the drops as not themselves needing any impetus to move, but providing impetus to others. A pseudo-etymological figure.
