The first word of the refrain, tárat, is grammatically ambiguous. It can be a 3rd sg. injunc. and is so taken by, e.g., Grassmann, Geldner, Lubotsky, and Lowe (Part. 281); certainly the same form in the same position in IX.107.15 tárat samudrám “he crosses the sea” is most probably a finite injunc. However, flg. one of Oldenberg’s possibilities, with AiG II.2.164 and apparently Renou (judging from his tr. “en traversant”) I prefer to take it as a neut. sg. pres.

part. in adverbial usage, in part because beginning and ending this short pāda-length refrain with two finite verbs, one injunc., one pres. indic., seems clunky: tárat sá mandī́dhāvati.

For another pāda-initial form in -at that I take as a participle see disc. of bhárat ad IX.52.1.

As to what Soma is crossing, it is most likely the waters (cf. ap-túr- IX.61.13, 63.5, 21), as suggested by Geldner, Renou, et al. - in this case perhaps the waters with which the stalk is swelled. Or, given IX.59.3b víśvāni duritā́tara in the immediately following hymn, it could be “all difficult passages.”
