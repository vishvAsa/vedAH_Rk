gṛṇāná- is found in the first and last vs. (22b, 24c); vss. 23 and 24 contain forms of árṣa-, pári, and cows. In addition vs. 22 seems to chain with the final vs. of the previous tṛca, 21: 22a asṛkṣata picks up 21b sṛjátā, and 22b śrávase echoes (deva)śrút(tamam) in 21c, while madíntama- (22b) contains the same splv. suffix as mádhumattama (21b), (deva)śrúttama- (21c).
