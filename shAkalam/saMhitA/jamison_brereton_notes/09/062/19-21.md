<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

There is some chaining between vss. (cows/milk in 19, 20; mádhu in 20, 21 and two mentions of gods in pāda c in 20, 21, incl. dat. pl. devébhyaḥ in each). In addition, all three vss. begin with the preverb ā́(univerbated and therefore accentless in 19a).
