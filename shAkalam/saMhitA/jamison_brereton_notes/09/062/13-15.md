The first two vss. contain forms of kaví-. The epithet “wide-going” (urugāyá13c) may be further specified in the phrase vimā́no rájasaḥ “measurer of the airy realm” (14b) -- in both cases probably a way of giving a cosmic dimension to the journey across the filter. The third vs. (15) does not participate in these commonalities.
