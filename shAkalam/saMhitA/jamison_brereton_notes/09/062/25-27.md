<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

This tṛca shows more signs of unity than others in this hymn, esp. in the 1st two vss. Both 25 and 26 contain pāda-initial pávasva (25a, 26c) and the variant phrases vācó agriyáḥ (25a) / agriyó vā́caḥ (26b), as well as forms of víśva- (25c víśvāni, 26c viśvam(ejaya)). In 27a Soma is addressed by the voc. kave, while 25c contains the phrase víśvāni kā́vyā.
