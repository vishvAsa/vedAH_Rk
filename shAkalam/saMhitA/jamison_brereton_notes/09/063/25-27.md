This tṛca shows clear signs of unity, indeed of a monotonous sort. Like the previous tṛca, each vs. in this one contains a form of páva-, but in this tṛca all three are the nom. pl. part. pávamānā(sā)ḥ, always opening the vs. Each vs. also contains one finite verb, an augmented form of √sṛj (asṛkṣata 25a, 27b; asṛgram 26b). The first two vss. also contain nom. pl. índavaḥ in the same metrical position (final in the b pāda). The lexeme ápa √han found in the previous tṛca (apaghnán 24a) also reappears here (26c ghnántaḥ … ápa) (and in the next tṛca).
