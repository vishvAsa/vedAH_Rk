On the structure of the last two hymns of the Jagatī group, see the published

introductions to IX.85 and 86. In brief, after a series of hymns of 5 vss. (IX.75-84), these last two have 12 vss. and 48 vss. respectively. However, they are clearly composites: IX.85 consists of three groups of four vss. apiece, IX.86 of 16 tṛcas. The standard principles of hymn arrangement can thus be restored.
