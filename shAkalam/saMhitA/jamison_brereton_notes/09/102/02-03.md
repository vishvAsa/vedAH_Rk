Trita figures in these two vss. Although the name Trita has several different referents, or at least several different roles, in the RV, in Maṇḍala IX he is the archetypal soma presser: see esp. comm. ad IX.37.4. In these two vss. there is also a play on the literal sense of tritá- ‘third’, which is played off against the dual pāṣyòḥ in 2a and the numeral trī́ṇi ‘three’ in 3a. The Anukr. ascribes this hymn to Trita Āptya, a mythical figure most prominent in X.8, but this ascription is presumably based on the occurrence of tritá- in vss. 2-3. Trita Āptya is credited with several other hymns in the RV, incl., in this maṇḍala, IX.33-34.
