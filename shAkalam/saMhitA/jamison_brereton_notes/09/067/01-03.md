Attributed to Bharadvāja, the tṛca shows elementary unity by positoning tvám at the beginning of each vs. ### 01
Grassmann derives dhārayú- from dhā́rā- ‘stream’ and glosses ‘strömend’, an idea that goes back to Sāyaṇa. Geldner follows suit (“der hervorsprudelnde”), though in n. 1a he entertains a derivation from √dhṛ, which underlies Renou’s “le mainteneur” (see his n.) I also think that √dhṛ is the correct etymon. There would be no reason to shorten the final of dhā́rā- (though dhā́ra-pūta- ‘purified by streams’ (?) and dhāra-vāká- ‘recitation for the streams’ (?) do give me pause), while there is a well-established relationship between -ā̆-yá-(ti) verbs and - ā̆-yú- adjectives (type devayá- / devayú-). Though it has a different accent and a different functional profile, dhā́ráyati is a very common verb, and it is easy to imagine the creation of a -yú- nominal to that stem. However, if it is derived from dhā́rā- ‘stream’, the sense should not be of the type given by Grassmann and Geldner, but rather ‘seeking streams’, as is standard with -yuformations to nouns. The idea would be that the soma, once pressed, goes forth to seek the ritual waters.
