As noted in the published introduction, these vss. are a self-contained purificatory spell, with all vss. ending with an act. impv. belonging to the pres. punā́ti: all 2nd sg. punīhi (naḥ) except 22c punātu (naḥ). The means of purification is, in the first instance, the filter (pavítra-), which of course literally means ‘instrument (-tra-) of purification’. 

The pavítra is mentioned in vss. 22-25, with other, non-physical means of purification added (e.g., the sacred formulation vss. 23-24), with these means appropriate to the gods who wield them (Savitar’s ‘impulsion’ [savá-] vs. 25). The first agent of purification is Soma Pavamāna himself (22), then Agni (23-24), then Savitar (25). The three - Soma, Agni, and Savitar - then appear together in 26, and in the final vs. (27) it opens out to all the divinities. The rhetoric is pretty flat, but the structure is a pleasing example of repetitive variation.
