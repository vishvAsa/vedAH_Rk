<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

This is the last tṛca of the hymn, attributed to Vasiṣṭha. The 1st two vss. are variants of each, couched in 2nd and 3rd ps. respectively: their first pādas differ only in their initial disyllable, with the rest identical: … tunnó abhíṣṭutaḥ; their second pādas both depict the journey to and across the filter, both beginning pavítram. The third vs. stands apart, though the identification of Soma as ‘demon-smasher’ in 20c is thematically linked to the plea in 21 that Soma “smash away” peril.
