<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

As noted in the published introduction, this tṛca shows a high degree of unity. To start with, every pāda but 2 (of 12), begins with a form of the 2nd sg. prn.: mostly nom. t u vám (28b, d, 29a, c, 30a) but also gen, táva (28a, 29b, d), with the final hemistich breaking the pattern with a single acc. t u vā́m (distracted; see comm. ad vs. 24 above) in c and a single dat. túbhya in d. Only 28c and 30b fail to open with such a form (and 28c has the enclitic te later in the pāda). In addition, all 3 vss. contain the voc. pavamāna (28c, 29d, 30b), and all three also have forms of víśva- 28b, d, 29a, 30d). Note also that víśvasya bhúvanasya in the first vs. (28b) is echoed by víśvā bhúvanāni in the last (30d), and that vídharmaṇi (29b) is taken up by better specified rájaso vídharmaṇi (30a); cf. also távemā́h (28a, 29b) varied by túbhyemā́ḥ (30d).

In terms of contents, the tṛca insistently asserts Soma’s universal rule over all cosmic elements.
