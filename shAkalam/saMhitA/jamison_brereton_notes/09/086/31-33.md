<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

After the tight structure of the preceding tṛca, we have returned to the lax stringing together of soma tropes. There is a lot of noise-making in 31 (b cakradat, c vāvaśānā́anūṣata), which is slightly echoed in 33 (b kánikradat).

Otherwise I see nothing particularly unifying.

As for external connections, GEN niṣkṛtám √yā in 32d is found also in 7b and 16a, and of course much of the soma lexicon is repeated elsewhere.
