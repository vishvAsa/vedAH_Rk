There is syntactic dependence between the two vss., at least by my reading: 2ab depends on vs. 1, while 2cd consists of a new cl., with a change of person. The Anukr. attributes the two vss. to Gaurivīti Śāktya; there is some support for this, in that V.29 (one of the three other hymns attributed to him [also X.73-74]) has an allusion to the myth involving Etaśa, the sun’s horse (V.29.5), who appears in our 2d.
