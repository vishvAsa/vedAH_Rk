The first metrical unit in the hymn has a third vs. appended to the pragātha with a 2-pāda configuration of 12 8, identified by the Anukr. as Dvipadā Virāj Bhurij. Arnold (248, E72) analyses vss. 2-3 as simply an extended Satobṛhatī (12 8 / 12 8 / 12 8). See Oldenberg (Proleg. 104-5) on the types of extensions of pragāthas, incl. this one. Since vs. 3 simply hangs off vs. 2 and need not be syntactically independent, the “extension” suggestion is quite plausible.

The vss. are knitted together by lexical repetition and variation. A sample of the lexical evidence: apsú is found in 1c, 2c; uttamám (1b) is picked up by úttaram (2d); the three instr. pl. ádribhiḥ (1d), ávibhiḥ (2a), góbhiḥ (2d) echo each other - the first two phonologically, the 2nd and 3rd semantically.
