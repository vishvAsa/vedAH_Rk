This tṛca is thematically unified by the journey theme, reinforced by two forms of √sṛj in vss. 10 (asṛkṣata) and 11 (ásṛgram), the former in an etym. figure. Note the juxtaposition of the newer s-aor. 3rd pl. middle and the older root aorist, with no apparent functional or semantic difference. On these two formations see Narten (Sig.Aor. 270-71); she claims that they were originally differentiated functionally and still are occasionally (see IX.86.4), but in almost all occurrences this difference has been lost.
