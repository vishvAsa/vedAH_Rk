On this tṛca see published introduction. It is so insistently Agni-focused (all three vss.

begin with a form of that stem, two as voc.) that the Anukramaṇī lists Agni as the deity of the three vss. But it is of course far more likely that Soma is being identified with Agni here.

The equation and poetic merging of these two ritual gods is found elsewhere, most notably in “the hardest hymn in the RV” (V.44), which is simultaneously applicable to both gods throughout its length. Their blending is shown here by the use of both Somian and Agnian vocab.: for the latter, see esp. puróhitaḥ (20b); for the former, the three forms of páva-, one each in each vs.: 19a pavase, 20a pávamānaḥ, 21a pavasva. Note that after this Agni tṛca the word sóma- doesn’t appear until vs. 29 and a likely identification with Indra (as well as comparison with the sun) intervenes.
