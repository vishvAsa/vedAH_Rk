<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

This tṛca does not show particular internal cohesion, but it has striking echoes of the preceding tṛca. Like vs. 1, vs. 4 begins pávasva; 4b begins abhí víśvāni like 1b, with a different acc. pl. following; 4c sákhā sákhibhya ūtáye is identical to 1c, save for the final word. Vs. 5 contains dhā́mabhiḥ echoing the two forms of dhā́man- in vss. 2-3. Only vs. 3 is free of links to the 1st tṛca.
