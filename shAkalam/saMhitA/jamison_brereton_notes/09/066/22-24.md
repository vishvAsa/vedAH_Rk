No strong signs of unity, though a form of pávamāna- opens vss. 22 and 24, but Soma as the sun in 22c returns in the theme of light and the defeat of darkness in 24bc.

The adj. vicakṣaṇáḥ ‘visible afar’ in 23c also participates in this imagery, partly matching viśvádarśataḥ ‘visible to all’ in the same position in 22c -- though the Engl. tr. ‘visible’ suggests a closer connection than exists in the Skt., which has √dṛś in 22 but √cakṣ in 23.

The light imagery in this tṛca may pick up on the identification with Agni in the previous tṛca, while the verb jáṅghanat that closes the tṛca (24c) may modulate towards an identification with Indra, probably found in the following tṛca.
