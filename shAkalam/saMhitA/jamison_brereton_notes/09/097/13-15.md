<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

No particular signs of cohesion in this tṛca, which is a collection of soma tropes. If there is any unifying theme it is movement, with eti (13b), eṣi (14b, c), arṣati (13d), arṣa (15d); for other repeated lexical items also pariṣicyámānaḥ (14d), pári … siktáḥ (15d). Also the final vs. (15) begins with evā́, the common hymn-ending summary particle - an effect that is muted in the published translation

The poet is supposed to be Upamanyu Vāsiṣṭha, presumably following up on the Manyu to whom the last tṛca was attributed.
