These two vss. each contain the injunc. (/subj.) aor. bhuvat, which in both cases I tr. as an immed. past: “he has become.” After considerable disc. with Ian Hollenbaugh, I now think that this particular form can also express a generic or habitual role or behavior of the subject, which Ian Hollenbaugh felicitously renders with the colloquial “he be-s X.” I am therefore now inclined to alter the tr. of both vss. to “he is the king …” / “he is, now as before, the wealth-lord …” In the absence of a non-colloquial Engl.

habitual/generic, “is” will have to do.
