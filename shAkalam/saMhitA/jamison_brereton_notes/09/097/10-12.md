This tṛca is attributed to Manyu Vāsiṣṭha, with the name possibly extracted from the previous tṛca, where manyú- in 8a is taken by some as part of a PN (see comm. above).

All three vss. contain a hemistich beginning índuḥ (10a, 11c, 12c); the verb pavate appears in all three (10a, 11b, 12a), though this is hardly unusual. In addition there is the presence of Indra (10b, 11c) or the gods in general (12b), as well as shared vocabulary: hemistich-final mádāya (10b, 11d), √pṛc ‘infuse’ (11a, 12b), \#devó devásya (11d) / #devó devā́n (12d). The net result is an impression of unity, despite the lack of a striking shared theme and the unremarkable nature of the shared material.
