The simplistic repetition of the previous tṛca contrasts markedly with the contents of this one, which is mind-bogglingly difficult and opaque. Oldenberg pronounces it “grösstenteils hoffnungslos.” Thematically it seems to deal with the distribution of wealth in a ritual/martial context, and it also shows signs of lexical cohesion, esp. the hapaxes mām̐ścatvá- (52b) and mā́m̐ścatva- (54b), also vásūni (52a, 53c), and of varied formulaic repetition: ayā́pavā́pavasvainā́(52a) / enā́ pavayā́pavasva (53a). My interpr. of this tṛca, in its many obscure details and in its entirety, is very different from the standard ones. In places it pushes the morphology, syntax, and semantics perhaps further than is warranted, and it may seems at times far-fetched. But it has, I think, a richer semantics than the other accounts, and above all it deliberately avoids the refuge taken by others, to make the difficult words into proper nouns.
