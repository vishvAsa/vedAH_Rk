As noted in the published introduction, this opening tṛca is marked by the identification of Soma and his attributes with a bull (vṛ́ṣan-). This theme is especially dominant in vss. 1 and 2: all three pādas of vs. 1 open vṛ́ṣā, with the bahuvrīhi vṛ́ṣa-vrataḥ ending the first hemistich; vs. 2 is even more insistent, with two forms of the stem (or deriv. vṛ́ṣṇya-) in each of the three pādas. By contrast, vs. 3 only nods at the theme: vṛ́ṣā appears once in 3a, though the final word of the vs., vṛdhi, may be meant to echo the word phonologically.
