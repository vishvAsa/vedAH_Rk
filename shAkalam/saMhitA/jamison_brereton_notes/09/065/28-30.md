<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

As if to make up for scanting tṛca cohesion earlier in the hymn, this tṛca is bound by bonds of iron: 13 occurrences of ā́, most construed with an acc. of a desirable object, all sharing a single verb (ā́) vṛṇīmahe (28b). In addition the three c pādas are identical. This refrain contains the nom. stem pā́nta- ‘drink’, not the pres. part.
