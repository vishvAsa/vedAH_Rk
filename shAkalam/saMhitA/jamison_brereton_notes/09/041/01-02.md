These two vss. are somewhat illuminated by IX.73.4-5, containing some very similar expressions: 73.4d padé-pade pāśínaḥ santi sétavaḥ “At every step there are snares that bind”; 73.5bcd … saṃdáhanto avratā́n / … ápa dhamanti … tvácam ásiknīm “…burning up those who follow no commandment, they blow away … the black skin.” Cf. also bhū́rṇayaḥ in 73.4b, corresponding to bhū́rṇayaḥ in our 1a, and note also that ápa dhamanti in 73.5c with “black skin” as its obj. resembles ghnántaḥ … ápa in our 1c, also with “black skin” as object.
