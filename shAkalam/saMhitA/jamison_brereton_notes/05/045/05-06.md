<details><summary>+Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

As noted in the published introduction, these two vss. form an omphalos and are structurally parallel, with the poet addressing his priest-poet colleagues with hortatory subjunctives. The immediacy of the vss. and the sacrificial context of the hymn make this a more likely scenario than Sāyaṇa.’s suggestion that the Aṅgirases are speaking these vss. For strenuous arguments against Sāyaṇa.’s interpr., see Lüders p. 327.
