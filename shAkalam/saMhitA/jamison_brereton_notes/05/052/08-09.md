I don't understand the force of utá sma, which opens 8c and 9a, with utá opening 9c. Klein (DGRV I.416-17) says that they introduce parallel statements about the Maruts and represent “concatenation across the stanza-boundary,” halfway between intrastanzaic and interstanzaic usage. But the role of sma, whatever it may be, seems downplayed in this description.
