Considered by Oldenberg to be an Anhang even to this set of appended hymns.

Its lexical hero is svastí-, a form of which appears in every pāda between 11a and 15a. The poet seems to be trying to show how many different syntactic constructions he can plug svastí- into. Unfortunately this is not sufficient to hold our attention.
