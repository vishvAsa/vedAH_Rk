Bloomfield’s disc. of the 2nd hemistich (Rig-Veda Repetitions) is interpretively useful, though somewhat dismissively phrased. It is too long to paraphrase here, but he acutely observes that previous translators have glossed over the problem that Indra is uncharacteristically depicted as at the end of his strength.
