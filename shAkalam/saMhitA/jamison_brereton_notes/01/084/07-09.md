Bloomfield (Rig-Veda Repetitions, ad I.7.8) suggests that each of these three verses reads like a brahmodya, with the last two words (the four-syllable tag índro aṅgá, which he considers to be prose “quite out of the metre”) serving as the answer. This analysis words best for vs. 7, but his separation of the two-word tag from the rest of the verse is clearly correct for all three verses -- though I do not think we need to consider índro aṅgá “simple prose.”
