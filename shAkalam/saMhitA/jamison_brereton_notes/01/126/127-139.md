Hymns of Paruchepa Daivodāsi This sequence of hymns, composed primarily in Atyaṣṭi meter, is one of my favorite collections in the RV. The elaborate meter showcases the patterned repetitions, echoes, and variations that are one of the specialties of Rigvedic poets.

The meter is configured as 12 12 8 / 8 8 / 12 8, generally with exact repetition, rhyme, or some kind of controlled variation between pāda b + c and f + g. This series is the only sustained set of Atyaṣṭi hymns in the RV; to Paruchepa’s son (/descendant) Anānata Pāruchepi is attributed the short Soma hymn IX.111.
