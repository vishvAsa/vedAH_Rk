Note identical openings to these two vss: tváṃ na indra rāyā́…, with the final word of the pādas showing very close phonological patterning: párīṇasā / tárūṣasā The standard tr. construe e with fg, such that rátham of e is the referent of anyám in f. But this seriously violates the structure of Atyaṣṭi, where de always constitute a unit. Moreover, “another chariot than us” would be a strange expression; we expect the anyám to refer to an animate opponent in such a construction, esp. if it is “intending harm” (rírikṣantam). I therefore generate a verbal form ‘help’ from the agent noun voc. ávitar that ends d: √av + rátham is found elsewhere (I.102.3, 112.12, etc.).
