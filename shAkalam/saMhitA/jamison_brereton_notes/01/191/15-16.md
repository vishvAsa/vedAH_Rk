The -ka- suffix is particularly prominent in these vss, appearing not only on the designation of the bug (kuṣumbhakáḥ, 2x), but also on the pronominal adj.

iyattakáḥ (‘such a one’), the pronoun takám, and the participle pravartamānakáḥ.

The word for ‘scorpion’, vṛ́ścika- only appears in that form, but appears to contain the -ka- suffix as well, very common in words for noxious insects (see my “-kasuffix,” IIJ 52 [2009]: 318).
