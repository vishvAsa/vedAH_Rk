These verses contain 3rd pl. act. root aorists ánu gman (2b) and ánu … guḥ (3b) to the associated roots √gam and √gā respectively, with no apparent difference in semantics. Here one might almost invoke the much over-used explanation of metrical convenience: both of these 3rd plurals are always (gman) or almost always (guḥ) pāda-final, with the first “making position” with a preceding light syllable (often ánu) and the latter not.
