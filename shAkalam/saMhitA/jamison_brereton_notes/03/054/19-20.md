The call to the gods to hear us, found first in vs. 1, returns here at almost the end of the hymn (19c, 20a, 20c). Note that in 19c the verb is sg. (śṛṇótu) with a series of sg. subjects (and one pl., ā́paḥ, in the middle), while in 20a it is pl.

(śṛṇvantu) with a grammatically pl. subj. In 20c a sg. nom. with an instr. pl. of accompaniment (rather like the construction I suggested in 17c) takes a sg. verb, which suggests that my suggestion for 17c is incorrect.
