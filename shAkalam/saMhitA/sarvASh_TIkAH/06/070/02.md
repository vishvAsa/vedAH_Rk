As noted in the published introduction, the focus here is on the various liquids associated with Heaven and Earth and their sheer moisture. Vs. 1 has ghee, honey, milk (by implication, in the compd. madhu-dúghe), and semen; in vs. 2 they are said never to dry up (ásaścantī) and possess streams, milk, ghee, and semen. The cmpd.

madhu-dúgha- ‘milking out honey’ in 1b is reprised by the VP ghṛtáṃ duhāte in 2b (with a diff. obj.). Another responsion is bhúvanānām ‘creatures’ (1a) and (asyá) bhúvanasya ‘(this) creation’ in 2c.
