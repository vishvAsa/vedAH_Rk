<details><summary>Tilak - Commentary</summary>

In this verse Indra asks Vr̥ṣākapi to go to his house (astam) and then return afterwards to the house (gr̥has) of Indra. But the question is where is Vpipbākapi's house and where is that of Indra ? The words in the original are dhanva, kr̥ntatra and nedīyas. Vriṣākapi is asked to go to dhanva, which is also kr̥ntatra. Sāyaṇa taka dhanva to mean a desert and kr̥ntatra in the sense that "the trees therein are cut off." But this meaning does not quite suit the context. What is meant by saying that Vr̥ṣākapi, who is admittedly the sun in a different form, should go to a forest? Where is that forest, and what does it imply? 

Dhanva is a word that occurs several times in the R̥gveda. In Rig. i. 38. 8 it is said to consist of three yojanas and is contrasted with the earth. Sāyaṇa there understands it to mean "sky or heavens," and I see no reason why we should not interpret the word in the same way in this verse. Dhanva therefore means "sky" or "heavens." But is it the vault above with three stages? No, the poet qualifies the idea by kr̥ntatra, meaning "cut off." It is thus evidently the portion of the heavens which is cut off. In other words, the idea here denoted is the same as that expressed by the phrase avarodhanam divah where heavens are closed, " where the view is obstructed," in Rig. ix. 113. 8. Dhanva, which is kr̥tantra, \* thus denotes the innermost part of the celestial sphere, the southern hemisphere or the Pitr̥yāna. (\* The only other place where kr̥ntatra is used in the R̥gveda is v. 27. 13, which Yāska and Sāyaṇa both interpret to mean that “waters come up from kr̥ntatra" 1. 8., a cloud." But it may be a well asked it Kr̥ntatrāt cannot here mean " from below." )

The poet knows that the vault of the heavens above him has three halts or stages which Vishṇu is said to have used as his three steps (Rig. i. 22. 17). But of the nether world the poet has no definite knowledge, and he therefore cannot specify the yojanas or the stages it contains. Thus he simply says that there are some yojanas therein. The first part of the verse may now be translated thus: "O Vr̥ṣākapi! go to the house (in) the celestial sphere which is cut off and which contains some yojanas or stages." In short, Indra means that Vpiṣakapi should now descend into the southern hemispere. 

The latter part of the verse literally means "and come to our house from nedīyas." Now nedīyas is again a word which neither Yāska dor Sāyaṇa seem to have properly understood. Pāṇini (v. 3.63) tells us that nedīyas is the comparative of antika. Now nedīyas cannot possibly be derived from antika by any change in the form of the latter word. Pānini therefore considers neda to be a substitute for antika, when the comparative form is to be derived. This is equivalent to saying that 'bet' is to be substituted for 'good' in deriving the comparative form of 'good' in English. I need not say how far such an expla nation would be regarded satisfactory. My own view is that nedīyas had lost its positive form in the times of Pāṇini, or perhaps its positive form was never in use like that of superior in English. But Pāṇini, who, as a grammarian, felt bound to account for all the forms, connected nedīyas with antika, probably because the ordinary meaning of nedīyas in his time was the same as that of the comparative form of antika. But we cannot infer from this that nedīyas might not have meant anything else in the days of Pāṇini. Paṇini might liave taken into account only the most ordinary sense of the word, and finding that a positive form was wanting connected it with the word which expressed the ordinary meaning in the positive form. The fact that Pāṇini considers nedīyas as the comparative of antika does not therefore preclude us from assuming, if we have other grounds to do so, that nedīyas originally meant something else in addition to its present sense ; for Pāṇini speaks of the form and not of the meaning of nedīyas. Having thus shown that the authority of Par̥ni is not against me, I shall now give my meaning of nedīyas. I think it means lower, being akin to neath, beneath, nether and corresponding words in other languages. (• Bopp derives O. H. G. nidar from  sk. ni down, and disapproves Grimm's suggestion that it should be traced to a Gothic verb niliun, natit, nethum, and divided as nid-ar, ar being a omparative termination, (Bopp. Com. Gr. Eng. Te, 1860, Vol. I., 382). K. Brugermann compares Sk. nedīyas with Av. nazd-yar meaning nearer, and derives the words from nazd (ni down and zd to sit). Cf. Sk. nīda Lat. nīdu, O. Ir. net, O H.G. nest= a nesting place (Comp. Gr. i., § 591, ii, $84, 135). Both bopp and Brugmann do not propose any new meaning of nedīyas. But it is evident that whichsoever derivation we adopt the word is connected with ni down, and if we find passages in the Brahmanas where it is contrasted with upariṣṭhāt, we can, I think, safely understand nedīyas to mean 'lower' as suggested by its etymology ; 'nearer' is secondary meaning.)

The suggestion, I know, will be received by some with surprise and suspicion, and I must give my grounds for proposing a new meaning. There is no passage in the R̥gveda where the use of nedīyas might be cousidered as definitely deciding its meaning. In Rig. v. 52. 6, viii. 26. 10 and x. 101. 3, nediṣtha or nedīyas might be supposed to mean lowest or lower. But the passages are not conclusive on this point, as the word there used might also be understood to mean 'nearest,' nearer,' according to Paṇini. In the Brāhmaṇas we, however, meet with more decisive passages. Thus in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa vi. 27 nedīyas is contrasted with upariṣṭhāt.\* +++(\* उपरिष्ठान् नेदीयसि भागे Ait. Br. vi. 27.)+++ Böhtlingk and Roth give a passage from the Kaṭhaka recension of Yajurveda (28. 4), which says, the ascends (ārohat) to the heavens from the nethiṣṭha world."+ +++(नेदिष्ठादेव स्वर्गलोकमारोहति। Kathak. 28. 4)+++ Here the word 'ascend' clearly shows that the netishtha world 10981 be undeistood to mean the lowest world,' world at the bottom. In the Tandya Brāhmaṇa iii. 4, 2, (3, 2) there occurs a passage where the directions for lowering the tone are given as follows:-"Just as after creeping up to the top of a high tree (a man) gradually comes lower and lower so, &c.". +++(\* यथा महावृक्षस्याग्रं सृप्त्वा नेदीयः सङ्क्रमात् सङ्क्रामत्य्, एवम् एतन् नेदीयः सङ्क्रमया नेदीयः सङ्क्रामात् सङ्क्रामति। Tan. Br. iii. 4.2. )+++ The word for lowering in the text in nedīyas sankramāt, and there is no possibility of mistaking its meaning. In the Tāndya Brāhmaṇa ii. 1. 3 the raising of the tone is described as ascending from top to top (agrāt agram); and nedīyas sankrama must, therefore, mean a gradual lowering of the voice. In fact, nedīyas sankrama represents the same idea as low-er-ing, that is, not taking a sudden leap down but descending from the highest point to the next lower, and so on.

In all these places Sāyaṇa explains nedīyas as meaning 'nearer' according to Pāṇini; but in every case he has to strain the words to suit the context. It was not, however, Sāyaṇa's fault ; for after nedīyas was once assigned to antika, all traces of its old meaning were naturally lost, and none dared to question Paṇini's authority. But we now know that in other languages neath means low, and in several passages in the Brāhmaṇas, we find nedīyas contrasted with 'upper' or 'top.' This, in my opinion, is sufficient to prove that nedīyas meant lower in the Vedic times. I have already shown that the authority of Pāṇini is not against understanding the word in this way. All that he has laid down is that nedīyas having no positive form should be derived from antika without saying whether nedīyas was or was not used in any other sense. I am therefore inclined to think that nedīyas might have had more than one meaning even in Pāṇini's time, but he took the most ordinary meaning and derived the comparative form from antika. This is course of time served in its turn to restrict the denotation of the word only to one meaning, viz., 'nearer.' 

I would therefore translate the verse thus, "O Vr̥ṣākapi! go to the house the celestial sphere which is cut off and which contains some (unknown) yojanas or stages. From your nether house come to our house. Indra is in the upper (portion) of the universe." Nediyas is thus contrasted with uttara in the burden of the song. Both are comparative forms. Indra is in the uttara (upper) regions, while Vr̥ṣākapi is going to the nedīyas (lower) world ; and Indra expects or rather requests Vr̥ṣākapi to come back again to his(Indra's) house. That is the gist of the whole verse.

The idea that the sun falls down from the autumnal equinox is an old one. To Ait. Br. iii. 18 and in Taitt. Br. i. 3. 12. 1 the ceremonies on on the Viṣūvān or the equinoctial day in a satra are described, and there we are told that "gods were afraid of the sun falling down from the sky and so supported him," and being thus supported he "became uttara to all". The ait. Br. iii. 18 has thus the same word uttara that we have in this verse, and it is natural to suppose that both relate to the same subject. I have also quoted a passage from the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa where nedīyas is contrasted with upariṣhṭat. From these I infer that the verse, we are now considering, describes the descent of the sun into the southern or the lower hemisphere, and that Indra asks him to come back again to the house of Gods, i.e., the northern hemisphere.

I have already given in full my reasons for understanding nedīyas in a different sense. But I may remark that, even accepting the common meaning of the word, the verse may still be interpreted in the way I have suggested.
