<details><summary>Tilak - Commentary</summary>

This is the most important verse in the whole hymn. It describes the circumstances under which Vr̥ṣākapi will return to Indra's house. Literally rendered it means, "O mighty Vriṣākapi! [^T22] When you rising upwards (or rather northwards) would come to (our) house, where would that great sinner Mr̥ga be? Where he, who misleads people, would go? Indra, &c." 

[^T22]: Pischel and Geldner suppose that the verse is addressed by a third person to Vrisakapi and Indra, probably because both these names occur in the vocative case and the verb is in plural. ln that case the verse would mean, “When Indra and Vr̥ahkkapi would both be in the house, where would the sinning Mr̥ga be, &c. ? " This interpretation does not, however, make any change in the part of the verse material for our purpose. For whichsoever construction we adopt the question still remains - Why is the Mr̥ga invisible when both Indra sod Vr̥aṣākapi are together?

Now Yāska, in whose days all traces of Canis being once a star in the heavens were lost, could not understand what to make of the statement "where would that great singer Mr̥ga be?" It means that Mr̥ga would not be seen, would not be visible, when Vriṣākapi goes to the house of Indra; but Yāska did not perceive what was intended by such a statement. He could not conceive that the constellation of Mr̥gaśiras would be invisible, when the sun in his upward march would be there at the beginning of the Devayāna, that is, when he comes to the house of Indra, and therefore he proposed to interpret Mr̥ga in the sense of “the sun" (Nirukta !3, 3). Mr̥ga, says he, is derived from mij to go, and means "going," "one who goes and goes and never stops,' in other words, "the sun." Now, says his commentator, when a person goes into a house he cannot be seen by the outsiders. So Vr̥ṣākapi, when he goes to the house, cannot be seen by the people on the earth!

I do not think that I need point out the highly artificial and inconsistent character of this explanation. The word Mr̥ga, so far as I know, is no where used in the R̥gveda in this sense. Again, if the word Mr̥ga in the third verse of this hymn is to be understood as meaning an antelope, is it not natural enough to suppose that the same Mr̥ga is re ferred to in this verse? Then, again, how can the sun be said to become invisible to the people when he is in the house of Indra? Nor can he be invisible to Indra whose house he enters. What can, in such a case, be the propriety of the word udancha or “ rising upwards"? If Mr̥ga means the sun according to Yāska, we shall have to suppose that the rising sun was invisible, a clear contradiction in terms. I am sure Yāska, here, tried to explain away the difficulty in the same way as he has done in the case of Vr̥ka. But, in the present instance, the solution he has proposed is, on the face of it, highly inconsistent, so much so that even Sāyaṇa, does not follow it.

Sāyaṇa, however, has nothiag else to propose, and he quietly leaves the word Mr̥ga as it is and unexplained in his commentary. In short, both Sāyaṇa and Yāska have found the verse too difficult to explain. The meaning I have proposed explains the verse in a natural and a simple manner, and further corroborates the statement in the R̥gveda previously referred to vis., "Canis awakened the r̥bhus at the end of the year. "

In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa i. 8. 2. 1, we are told that the Vedic priests, e.g., Maisoni, observed the position of the sun amongst stars in the morning, and, as the Nakṣatras disappear when the sun rises, they determined the position by observing what Nakṣatra rose a little before the sun. The present verse records an observation to make which no greater skill is required. It tells us that when Vr̥ṣākapi went to the house of Indra his Mr̥ga was not visible anywhere, thus clearly indicating that sun rose with Orion on that day. The word udancha is especially remarkable in this case. The sun must be udancha when he goes to the house of Indra, which, the burden of the song tells us, is in the northern or the upper part of the universe. This verse, therefore, clearly describes not merely the rising sun, but the position of the rising sun amongst the constellations when he is at the vernal equinox, the entrance of the house of gods or the house of Indra. Sāyaṇa and Yāska have completely missed this point and have made Vr̥ṣākapi represent the rising sun as an unnecessary rival to Savita (Nirukta 12. 12). 

If the meaning I have proposed is correct, we have here a record of the position of the sun at the vernal equinox. I take pulvaghas in the original to mean "great sinner;" but it may be translated as Yāska proposes by "omnivorous" or "voracious." But in either case I would take it as referring to the antelope's spoiling the things of Indrāṇī. The point is that the sinning Mr̥ga would not be with Vr̥ṣākapi when he again goes to the house of Indra, and Indrāṇī would have no cause to complain of the presence of the odious Mr̥ga at the time.
