Indra [or the All Gods?]
Brhaduktha V ̥ āmadevya
8 verses: triṣṭubh
A puzzling and enigmatic hymn, with close ties to the previous hymn, especially at the beginning. The first puzzle is that this, the second of the three Br̥haduktha hymns (X.54–56), is assigned Indra as its deity in the Anukramaṇī, but is longer (eight verses) than the previous hymn (X.54, six verses), which is also dedicated to Indra. Bergaigne (per Oldenberg 1888: 226) suggests that the ascription is incor
rect, and that this is really an All God hymn, as is the next one (X.56, seven verses). Although Oldenberg rejected this suggestion (1888: 238–39) on grounds of content, we are inclined to accept it. Although Indra is the clear or likely deity of most of the verses (1–3, 7–8), the center part of the hymn (vss. 4–6) is not, in our view, Indraic. Moreover, the numerology (see esp. vss. 2–3, 5) and the riddling phraseol
ogy throughout, without expressed referents, are quite reminiscent of a certain type of speculative All God hymn.
The first verse of the hymn exactly matches that of X.54 in structure (with X.55.1 somewhat clearer syntactically), and their second pādas are almost identical. Both concern the call that Heaven and Earth issued to Indra in fright, and go on, in the second hemistich, to recount other of Indra’s deeds. And this verse also takes up the theme of the “hidden name” found also in X.54.4. But already in X.55.1 we meet an unidentified referent: “the sons of your (or a?) brother,” especially puzzling because, as far as we know, Indra has no brother.
The name theme continues in verse 2, but introduces a light, into which five unidentified dear ones merge. Nothing further is made of this merger, but the same lexeme “merge into” (sáṃ √viś) is used in the next hymn (X.55.1) for the merger of the body of the dead with light in some unspecified distant place, and it seems likely that our passage touches on the same theme of death and transfiguration. Though verse 3 begins with a conventional deed of Indra, filling the world-halves, it pursues both the numerology of verse 2 and the light, now both fragmented and unified. Although various identifications of the referents here have been proposed, none is entirely convincing; moreover, the poet seems more interested in keeping us guess ing than in providing a clear roadmap.
What does seem clear is that the cosmic context of Heaven and Earth and the focus on light(s) have led us to astronomical imagery, which occupies the next three verses of the hymn. We begin (vs. 4) with Dawn, explicitly identified, and celebrated in a for mulaic final pāda that is modeled on the refrain of a famous mystical All God hymn, III.55, where the “one and only lordship” is that of the gods. The next verse (5) has no identified referents at all, and the language is difficult and cryptic. Nonetheless it seems to refer to the moon traveling among the stars, until swallowed up by a gray one—perhaps the gray twilight of dawn or the smoke of the ritual fire kindled at dawn. The poet seems to recognize the hyper-“poetic” quality of this description (5c) and provides a simply phrased (though not simply interpreted) gloss in pāda d. Verse 6 is most easily interpretable as referring to the sun, who is called a “ruddy eagle” elsewhere in the R̥gveda, but it could also be Agni or Indra; if the latter, it provides a transition to the final two verses (7–8), which belong more clearly to Indra.">

Indra [or the All Gods?]<br>
Brhaduktha V ̥ āmadevya<br>
8 verses: triṣṭubh<br>
A puzzling and enigmatic hymn, with close ties to the previous hymn, especially  at the beginning. The first puzzle is that this, the second of the three Br̥haduktha  hymns (X.54–56), is assigned Indra as its deity in the Anukramaṇī, but is longer  (eight verses) than the previous hymn (X.54, six verses), which is also dedicated to  Indra. Bergaigne (per Oldenberg 1888: 226) suggests that the ascription is incor<br>
rect, and that this is really an All God hymn, as is the next one (X.56, seven verses).  Although Oldenberg rejected this suggestion (1888: 238–39) on grounds of content,  we are inclined to accept it. Although Indra is the clear or likely deity of most of  the verses (1–3, 7–8), the center part of the hymn (vss. 4–6) is not, in our view,  Indraic. Moreover, the numerology (see esp. vss. 2–3, 5) and the riddling phraseol<br>
ogy throughout, without expressed referents, are quite reminiscent of a certain type  of speculative All God hymn.<br>
The first verse of the hymn exactly matches that of X.54 in structure (with X.55.1  somewhat clearer syntactically), and their second pādas are almost identical. Both  concern the call that Heaven and Earth issued to Indra in fright, and go on, in the  second hemistich, to recount other of Indra’s deeds. And this verse also takes up the  theme of the “hidden name” found also in X.54.4. But already in X.55.1 we meet an  unidentified referent: “the sons of your (or a?) brother,” especially puzzling because,  as far as we know, Indra has no brother.<br>
The name theme continues in verse 2, but introduces a light, into which five  unidentified dear ones merge. Nothing further is made of this merger, but the same  lexeme “merge into” (sáṃ √viś) is used in the next hymn (X.55.1) for the merger of  the body of the dead with light in some unspecified distant place, and it seems likely  that our passage touches on the same theme of death and transfiguration. Though  verse 3 begins with a conventional deed of Indra, filling the world-halves, it pursues  both the numerology of verse 2 and the light, now both fragmented and unified.  Although various identifications of the referents here have been proposed, none is  entirely convincing; moreover, the poet seems more interested in keeping us guess ing than in providing a clear roadmap.<br>
What does seem clear is that the cosmic context of Heaven and Earth and the focus  on light(s) have led us to astronomical imagery, which occupies the next three verses  of the hymn. We begin (vs. 4) with Dawn, explicitly identified, and celebrated in a for mulaic final pāda that is modeled on the refrain of a famous mystical All God hymn, III.55, where the “one and only lordship” is that of the gods. The next verse (5) has  no identified referents at all, and the language is difficult and cryptic. Nonetheless it  seems to refer to the moon traveling among the stars, until swallowed up by a gray  one—perhaps the gray twilight of dawn or the smoke of the ritual fire kindled at  dawn. The poet seems to recognize the hyper-“poetic” quality of this description (5c)  and provides a simply phrased (though not simply interpreted) gloss in pāda d. Verse  6 is most easily interpretable as referring to the sun, who is called a “ruddy eagle”  elsewhere in the R̥gveda, but it could also be Agni or Indra; if the latter, it provides a  transition to the final two verses (7–8), which belong more clearly to Indra.</p>

<p>इस सूक्त में ‘इन्द्र’ परमात्मा है, उसके द्वारा सृष्टि के आरम्भ में ऋषियों को वेदमन्त्र प्रदान करना, ज्योतिष्मान् वस्तुओं में ज्योति भरना, मोक्ष में मानवमात्र का अधिकार आदि विषय हैं।</p>

<details><summary>ब्रह्ममुनि - भावार्थः</summary>
<p>भावार्थभाषाः -  जो लोग नास्तिक हैं,ईश्वर की उपासना नहीं करते हैं, वे परमात्मा के रहस्यपूर्ण नामों को नहीं समझ सकते हैं। उन्हें ईश्वर का भय करना चाहिए। जड़जगत् में प्रमुख द्युलोक और पृथ्वीलोक प्रकाशक और प्रकाश्य लोक उससे भय करते हुए जैसे संसार में अपना काम करते हैं और चेतन जगत् में राज्य तथा प्रजा जन भी उससे भय करते हुए अपना-अपना कर्त्तव्यपालन करते हैं। परमात्मा पितृवत् सब प्राणियों का रक्षक है ॥१॥</p>
