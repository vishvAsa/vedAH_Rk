Praise of a Horse (Aśvastuti)
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
22 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 3, 6
The first of the two Aśvamedha hymns focuses on the actual sacrifice, with an almost cinematic treatment of the proceedings and an unflinching look at the gory details. The hymn begins with the parading of the horse on the day of sacrifice: the year-long preliminaries in the classical Aśvamedha are not mentioned here, and it is not easy to tell how much elaboration accreted to this ritual in the post-R̥gvedic period—though it seems likely that the R̥gvedic version was a much simpler affair.
After an initial verse calling on an array of gods to bear witness to the celebra tion of the horse, there follow three verses (2–4) devoted to the goat that is led in front of the horse and that is itself sacrificed before the killing of the horse. The goat is the only sacrificial animal mentioned in the hymn besides the horse, in contrast to the classical version of the rite in which a multitude of wild and domestic animals are, at least theoretically, bound for sacrifice (and in general then released). In verses 5–6 a variety of priests (5) and minor ritual functionaries (6; see also the cooks in vs. 12) are mentioned—the priests being urged, somewhat shockingly, to “fill your bellies” on the sacrifice. This group of officiants seems to correspond on the human level to the gods assembled in verse 1, and all are thus implicated in the performance of the sacrifice, as are the poet himself and his fel
low seers in verse 7.
The gaze then turns to the sacrifice proper (vss. 8–17) and to the equipment asso ciated with the horse (vss. 8, 14, 16), the equipment for cooking the oblation (vs. 13), and, most dramatically, the physical evidence of the slaughter: the fly-blown flesh and the sticky blood and guts (vs. 9), the bloated belly and the smell of the butchered animal (vs. 10), the cooking juices running off the skewered beast on344 I.162
the fire (vs. 11). All of the mentioned paraphernalia and the gore are meant to accompany the horse itself to the gods. This section of the hymn gains much of its power from a dual focus: the gritty reality of an actual sacrifice competes with the reverential attitude to the victim, regularly addressed in the 2nd person—such that the horse is endowed almost with personhood while at the same time being dismem
bered, cooked, and consumed. For this reason, in 3rd-person contexts we use the pronouns “he, him, his” for the horse, rather than “it,” et cetera: the poet will not allow us to objectify or neuter-ize the animal and requires us to come to terms with what “we” are doing to “him.”
The description of the dismembering becomes more detailed beginning in verse 18, where the axe approaches the horse’s ribs. Although this carving up logically precedes some of the sacrificial actions treated before—especially the cooking of the already butchered horse—there is a reason for its positioning here. We are entering the third and last part of the hymn, in which the horse is sent on his journey to the gods. The emphasis in these carving verses (18–20) is on the proper order of the cut
ting and the patterned positioning of the pieces of the horse, so that he can make its own way on his “undamaged” legs (vss. 18, 20). The pieces of the horse are arranged to re-form the actual body of the horse, and this reconstituted body is complemented by the lifebreath (ātman) that is also making the journey to the gods (vs. 20). The climax is reached in verse 21, where the horse is assured that he is not dead or injured and that his journey to the gods will be made easily, in company with the mounts of the gods. The hymn ends (vs. 22) with the hope that the sacrificed horse will bring us good things, and with an unemphatic prayer for our “guiltlessness,” presumably because of the potential guilt associated with the killing of the horse.
To those who know the classical śrauta version of the Aśvamedha the most strik ing omission in this hymn is any mention of the sexual intercourse (or simulated inter course) of the chief wife of the king and sacrificer with the just slaughtered horse. If our interpretation of X.86, the Vr̥ṣākapi hymn, is correct—that it is a burlesqued ver sion of an Aśvamedha with a randy monkey as victim—the missing sexual element in our hymn here was omitted out of delicacy rather than being unknown to the R̥gveda.">

Praise of a Horse (Aśvastuti)<br>
Dīrghatamas Aucathya<br>
22 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 3, 6<br>
The first of the two Aśvamedha hymns focuses on the actual sacrifice, with an  almost cinematic treatment of the proceedings and an unflinching look at the gory  details. The hymn begins with the parading of the horse on the day of sacrifice: the  year-long preliminaries in the classical Aśvamedha are not mentioned here, and it  is not easy to tell how much elaboration accreted to this ritual in the post-R̥gvedic  period—though it seems likely that the R̥gvedic version was a much simpler affair.<br>
After an initial verse calling on an array of gods to bear witness to the celebra tion of the horse, there follow three verses (2–4) devoted to the goat that is led  in front of the horse and that is itself sacrificed before the killing of the horse.  The goat is the only sacrificial animal mentioned in the hymn besides the horse,  in contrast to the classical version of the rite in which a multitude of wild and  domestic animals are, at least theoretically, bound for sacrifice (and in general  then released). In verses 5–6 a variety of priests (5) and minor ritual functionaries  (6; see also the cooks in vs. 12) are mentioned—the priests being urged, somewhat  shockingly, to “fill your bellies” on the sacrifice. This group of officiants seems to  correspond on the human level to the gods assembled in verse 1, and all are thus  implicated in the performance of the sacrifice, as are the poet himself and his fel<br>
low seers in verse 7.<br>
The gaze then turns to the sacrifice proper (vss. 8–17) and to the equipment asso ciated with the horse (vss. 8, 14, 16), the equipment for cooking the oblation (vs.  13), and, most dramatically, the physical evidence of the slaughter: the fly-blown  flesh and the sticky blood and guts (vs. 9), the bloated belly and the smell of the  butchered animal (vs. 10), the cooking juices running off the skewered beast on344 I.162<br>
the fire (vs. 11). All of the mentioned paraphernalia and the gore are meant to  accompany the horse itself to the gods. This section of the hymn gains much of its  power from a dual focus: the gritty reality of an actual sacrifice competes with the  reverential attitude to the victim, regularly addressed in the 2nd person—such that  the horse is endowed almost with personhood while at the same time being dismem<br>
bered, cooked, and consumed. For this reason, in 3rd-person contexts we use the  pronouns “he, him, his” for the horse, rather than “it,” et cetera: the poet will not  allow us to objectify or neuter-ize the animal and requires us to come to terms with  what “we” are doing to “him.”<br>
The description of the dismembering becomes more detailed beginning in verse  18, where the axe approaches the horse’s ribs. Although this carving up logically  precedes some of the sacrificial actions treated before—especially the cooking of the  already butchered horse—there is a reason for its positioning here. We are entering  the third and last part of the hymn, in which the horse is sent on his journey to the  gods. The emphasis in these carving verses (18–20) is on the proper order of the cut<br>
ting and the patterned positioning of the pieces of the horse, so that he can make its  own way on his “undamaged” legs (vss. 18, 20). The pieces of the horse are arranged  to re-form the actual body of the horse, and this reconstituted body is complemented  by the lifebreath (ātman) that is also making the journey to the gods (vs. 20). The  climax is reached in verse 21, where the horse is assured that he is not dead or injured  and that his journey to the gods will be made easily, in company with the mounts of  the gods. The hymn ends (vs. 22) with the hope that the sacrificed horse will bring  us good things, and with an unemphatic prayer for our “guiltlessness,” presumably  because of the potential guilt associated with the killing of the horse.<br>
To those who know the classical śrauta version of the Aśvamedha the most strik ing omission in this hymn is any mention of the sexual intercourse (or simulated inter course) of the chief wife of the king and sacrificer with the just slaughtered horse. If  our interpretation of X.86, the Vr̥ṣākapi hymn, is correct—that it is a burlesqued ver sion of an Aśvamedha with a randy monkey as victim—the missing sexual element in  our hymn here was omitted out of delicacy rather than being unknown to the R̥gveda.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>Āyu = <strong>vāyu</strong> (āyuḥ satatagantā <strong>vāyuḥ</strong>, vakāralopo vā);</p>
<p>Ṛbhukṣin = Indra; but,here <strong>Prajāpati</strong>, he in whom the <strong>ṛbhus</strong>,or the <strong>devas</strong>, abide (kṣiyanti); sprung from the gods: <strong>devaja</strong>-tasya = born as the type of various divinities, who are identified with different parts (e.g. uṣā vā <strong>aśvasya</strong> medhyasya <strong>śiraḥ</strong>: <strong>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</strong> 1.1.1);</p>

<p>Let not Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman, Āyu, Indra the lord of the R̥bhus, and  the Maruts disregard us<br>
when we shall proclaim the heroic deeds of the prizewinning, god-born  racehorse at the ritual distribution.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>Although the collection of gods serving as witnesses in ab seems somewhat random, the same set recurs in V.41.2, as Geldner points out. The reason for their association there is no clearer than here.</p>
<p>Pāda d, pravakṣyā́maḥ (vidathé) vīryā̀ṇi, is a variant on the famous opening of I.32, the great Indra hymn, índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi právocam. The gen. índrasya of I.32.1 is matched by the long gen. phrase in our c: (yád) vājíno devájātasya sápteḥ “of the prize-winning, god-born race-horse.” For another variant on this phrase in Dīrghatamas’s oeuvre, see I.154.1. It is striking here that vīryā̀ṇi ‘heroic/manly’ deeds are attributed to a horse; the establishment of “personhood” for the horse, discussed in the published introduction, begins here in the very first verse.</p>

<p>“When they, (the priests), bring the prepared offering to the presence (of the horse), who has been bathed and decorated with rich (trappings), the various-coloured goat going before him, bleating, becomes an acceptable offering to <strong>Indra</strong> and <strong>Pūṣan</strong>.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>The prepared offering: rātim-gṛbhītām = lit. the seized wealth; the offering to be made for the horse;</p>
<p>Pūṣan = <strong>Agni</strong>; the goat is to be tied to the front of the horse at the sacrificial <strong>post</strong>, such a goat, black-necked, kṛṣnagrīva (<strong>āgneyaḥ</strong> kṛṣṇagrīvaḥ: <strong>Taittirīya</strong> <strong>Saṃhitā</strong> 5.5.22), being always regarded as an <strong>āgneya</strong> <strong>paśu</strong>, or victim sacred to Agni, and to be offered to him (<strong>Kātyāyana</strong> <strong>Sūtra</strong> 98). A black goat is also dedicated to pūṣan, along with <strong>soma</strong> (<strong>Yajus</strong>. xxix.58; but, he is also to be attached to the <strong>nābhi</strong> or middle of the horse (Yajus. xxiv.1)</p>

<p>When they lead the gift [=goat] held fast in front of (the horse, which is)  decked out with a fresh garment and with family treasure,<br>
facing well forward, constantly bleating, the goat, representing all forms,  passes into the fold of Indra and Pūṣan.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>It may not be clear in the published translation that it is the horse that is bedecked (prā́vṛtasya), not the goat.</p>
<p>viśvárūpa- modifying the goat in c is taken by most as a bland color term (Geldner/Witzel Gotō ‘allfarbig’, Doniger ‘dappled’), but, esp. because in the next vs. (3b) the goat is called viśvádevya-, I think the qualifier is meant to convey more meaning: perhaps to indicate that the goat stands for all the other animals (which, as disc. in the published introduction, are literally tied up for sacrifice in the later versions of the Aśvamedha), hence my “representing all forms.”</p>

<p>This billy-goat, belonging to all the gods, is led in front, along with the  prizewinning horse, as Pūṣan’s portion.<br>
When (they lead the goat) as the pleasing fore-offering along with the  steed, it is Tvaṣṭar himself who stimulates him for (the deed) that<br>
brings good fame.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>It is appropriate that the goat, if it “represents all forms” (see disc. of the previous vs.), should belong to all the gods. That it should also be “Pūṣan’s portion” (pūṣṇó bhāgáḥ, 3b and 4c) probably follows from the fact that Pūṣan “has goats for horses” (ajā́śva-: 5x, always of Pūṣan) and is generally associated with goats.</p>
<p>As for Tvaṣṭar’s involvement, Geldner (sim. Witzel Gotō) simply says that Tvaṣṭar is the creator esp. of animals, but I think there is a tighter connection. Tvaṣṭar is a required presence in the Āprī hymns, the litanies that accompany the animal sacrifice. The verse devoted to him in each hymn occurs immediately before the “Lord of the Forest,” namely the stake to which the sacrificial animal is tied, releases the animal for sacrifice. Just before that, Tvaṣṭar both produces life (e.g., II.3.9, III.4.9-VII.2.9) and assists at the sacrifice (V.5.9), escorting the sacrificial animal to the gods (X.70.9) or at least pointing the way (II.3.9). Most strikingly Tvaṣṭar is once called viśvárūpa- (I.13.10) and several times enacts that epithet dramatically: I.188.9 tváṣṭā rūpā́ṇi hí prabhúḥ paśū́n víśvān samānajé “Because preeminent Tvaṣṭar anointed all the beasts (with) their forms”; X.110.9 rūpaír ápiṃśad bhúvanāni víśvā “he adorned all the creatures with their forms.” In our verse Tvaṣṭar stimulates/quickens the goat immediately before its sacrifice and indeed for its sacrifice, and that goat has just been characterized as viśvárūpa-. Thus Tvaṣṭar’s constant appearance in the Āprī hymns shows that this god has a defined role in the animal sacrifice, and that role, somewhat paradoxically, involves both giving life and setting the stage for taking it away by sacrifice. This is less of a paradox in the conceptual context of the animal sacrifice: as noted in the published introduction, a good deal of this hymn is devoted to reconstituting the sacrificed horse and endowing it with life-breath. Tvaṣṭar thus has a role in both, and we see it here first in connection with the goat that represents all creatures. Tvaṣṭar recurs in vs. 19 below.</p>

<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>The invoker of the gods: designations applied to eight of the sixteen priests employed at a solemn rite: the two first are: <strong>hotā</strong> and <strong>adhvaryu</strong>;</p>
<p>Avayāj = pratiprasthātā, who brings and plural ces the offering;</p>
<p>Agnimindha = agnīdh, the kindler of the fire;</p>
<p>Grāvagrābha = the praiser of the stones that bruise the Soma,or he who applies the stones to that purpose;</p>
<p>Śaṃstā = praśāstā;</p>
<p>Suvipra = <strong>Brahmā</strong> (brahmaiko jāte jāte vidyām vadatibrahmā sarvavidyaḥ <strong>sarva</strong> veditumarhati: <strong>Nirukta</strong> 1.8); replenish the rivers: <strong>vakṣaṇā</strong> apṛṇadhvam, <strong>nadīḥ</strong> pūrayata, fill the rivers; the consequence of sacrifice being rain and fertility; or, it may mean, offer rivers of butter, milk, curds, and the like</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The list of priests contains the hapax ā́vayā(ḥ), whose derivation and meaning are unclear. For suggestions and disc. see, e.g., Oldenberg, Geldner, Renou I tentatively favor a connection with áva √yā ‘propitiate, expiate’, but the form presents grave difficulties for that analysis. For one thing, we should expect a root-noun cmpd.</p>
<p>(*)avayā́- with short initial vowel and accent on the root &ndash; and in fact we get just that form in I.173.12. See detailed disc. by Scarlatta (404-7, with our form treated in n. 565).</p>
<p>However, it can be pointed out that this lexeme is mutilated elsewhere &ndash; e.g., in nearby I.165.15 (but Agastya, not Dīrghatamas), where vayā́m is better read ‘vayā́m (i.e., avayā́m), which sandhi form its position after tanvè would allow. Thus, the connection with áva √yā reflected in the published translation is quite insecure, and it may be best to follow Oldenberg in accepting the traditional analysis as ā́-vayas-, rendering it ‘whose life force is (right) here’. This avoids the formal difficulties, but I don’t see what kind of priest this would be.</p>
<p>There is a mild disconnect between the two hemistichs: the first half is a list entirely in the nominative, but the second contains a 2nd pl. impv. ā́pṛṇadhvam, whose 2nd ps. subjects should be the nominatives of ab.</p>

<p>“Whether they be those who cut the (sacrificial) <strong>post</strong>, or those who bear the post, or those who fasten the rings on the top of the post, to which the horse (is bound); or those who prepare the vessels in which the food of the horse is dressed; let the exertions of them all fulfil our expectation.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>The post: twenty-one <strong>posts</strong>, of different kinds of wood, each twenty-one cubits long, are to be set up, to which the different animals are to be fastened, amounting to three hundred and forty-nine, besides two hundred and sixty wild animals, making a total of six hundred and nine (<strong>Kātyāyana</strong>); the text seems to refer to a single post: caṣālam ye aśvayūpāya takṣati: caṣāla = a wooden ring, or bracelet, on the top of the sacrificial post; or, it was perhaps a metal ring at the foot of the post</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>The hewers of the sacrificial post and its conveyors, those who<br>
fashion the knob for the post for the horse,<br>
and those who assemble the equipment for cooking the steed—let the  applause also of those urge us on.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The list of personnel involved in the sacrifice here includes some apparently marginal and humble roles, perhaps to implicate the largest possible group in the potential blood-guilt of the sacrifice.</p>
<p>I render the utó in d with ‘also’; this is also Klein’s tr., though his disc. of the passage seems to seek a straight conjunctive role (DGRV I.448-49). See the same expression in 12d.</p>

<details><summary>Griffith</summary>
<p>The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those who carve the knob to deck the Horse&rsquo;s stake;<br>
Those who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed,&ndash;may the approving help of these promote our work.</p>

<p>“Whatever (portion) of your slaughtered (body) fall from your carcass when it is being roasted by the fire, (escaping) from the spit; let it not be left on the ground,nor on the (sacred) grass, but let it (all) be given to the longing gods.”</p>

<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>Gātrād agninā pacyamānād abhi śūlam:in the preceding hymn, śṛtapākam = boiling; and a <strong>ukha</strong>, a pot or cauldron is specified in hymn 13 for the same purpose; this use is at variance with the use of <strong>śūla</strong> or spit; the inference is that part was boiled and part was roasted; it is suggested that the portion that falls may be the <strong>rasa</strong>, the dripping, which is to be received upon <strong>darbha</strong> grass, afterwards probably to be thrown on the fire</p>

<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>As a covering for the horse: at the time of putting the horse to death, the <strong>adhīvāsa</strong> (cf. <strong>Kātyāyana</strong> <strong>Sūtra</strong> 145), a curtain is held,behind which the principal <strong>queen</strong> lies through the night by the side of the horse</p>

<p>The mantel they spread out for the horse, the over-mantel, and the gold  (trappings) that are for him,<br>
the harness, and the foot-fetter—(all these), his own dear things, hold  the steed fast among the gods.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The placement of árvantam amid the pieces of tackle associated with him seems strange at first, but in fact it can be seen as iconic: these various items hold him, and so he’s surrounded by them. It’s also clever that the various things are in the neuter, and so it is not till the verb appears (ā́yāmayanti at the very end of the vs.) that it becomes clear that they are the subjects of the verb and therefore nominative, while árvantam is clearly accusative.</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“Whoever has goaded you in your paces, either with heel or with whip, whilst nothing in your strength&ndash; all these (vexations) I pour out with holy prayers, as oblation with the ladle.”</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>If, in riding you, anyone goaded (you) with his heel or with a whip,  along with too much “come on, come on,”<br>
I make all these sweet for you with a sacred formulation, as (priests)  sweeten them [=oblations?] by the ladling of the oblation at the rites.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The first hemistich is one of the few places in the RV that depicts horses being ridden (see also I.155.1, 163.2 &ndash; though for an alternative for the latter see comm. ad loc. &ndash; 163.9): both sādé lit. ‘in the seat’, here tr. ‘in riding’, and the mention of goading with a heel require a rider physically on a horse.</p>
<p>I follow the general interpr. of śū́kṛta- as containing a syllable śū́used to urge on horses, hence my “come on, come on.” Although Google tells me that “chirrup” and “tchick” are so used (in English, or whatever we might call it), I judged that such a tr. would simply sow confusion.</p>
<p>The three disfavored ways of goading a horse &ndash; heel, whip, and excessive śū́- making &ndash; are not parallel, or rather heel and whip go together and śū́is something else, and they are therefore summed up with useful vagueness by sárvā tā́“all these” in d. The vagueness is also useful because none of the three is a particular suitable object for sūdayāmi ‘I make sweet’, even in its most attenuated sense (Geldner “… mache ich … wieder gut”).</p>
<p>The neut. pl. tā́in the simile in c is more mysterious. hávis- ‘oblation’ is a standard obj. of sūdáya-, but it is coopted here by the gen. háviṣaḥ. I have nonetheless supplied ‘oblations’ as the referent of tā́. Geldner supplies “die Fehler” on grounds of contextual sense only. He also cites Mah. as explaining tā́as “nur Füllwort” &ndash; an explanation I’d like to be able to use more often!</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>
<p>If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his heel or with his whip distressed thee,<br>
All these thy woes, as with the oblations&rsquo; ladle at sacrifices, with my prayer I banish.</p>

<p>Wenn man dich beim Reiten durch übermäßiges Hetzen oder mit der Ferse oder der Peitsche angespornt hat, all das mache ich dir mit einem Segen wieder gut, wie mit einem Löffel Opferspeise die Fehler im Gottesdienst.</p>

<p>“The axe penetrates the thirty-four ribs of the swift horse; the beloved of the gods, (the immolators), cut up (the horse) with skill, so that the limbs may be unperforated, and recapitulating joint by joint.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>Thirty-four ribs: it is noted that other animals have only 24 ribs;</p>
<p>Unperforated: acchidrā <strong>gātrā</strong>: the <strong>viśasana</strong> <strong>kartāraḥ</strong>, or dissectors, are to utter the name of the parts, as heart, tongue,breast, as they divide them; and are to so separate them that they may not have holes or perforations, they may not be mangled</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>The axe converges on the thirty-four ribs of the prizewinning horse,  who has connection with the gods.<br>
Arrange his legs, undamaged, into patterns, and carve them up joint by  joint, having called them out in order.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The preverb sám ‘together’ in sám eti may seem an odd choice in a verse concerning cutting the horse apart. However, it sets up a contrastive pairing with ví śasta ‘cut apart / carve up’ at the end of the 2nd hemistich, and it also anticipates (or promises) the rejoining of the parts of the horse that ends the hymn.</p>
<p>As it turns out, horses have 36 ribs, not 34. Max Müller noted this in 1875 and got a potential explanation from T. H. Huxley &ndash; that it may be that they’re cutting the rib cartilage and they don’t cut the last two ribs in order to keep the carcass together: [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_7/June_1875/A_C urious_Question_of_Horses&rsquo;_Ribs]</p>

<p>The caus. redupl. aor. ā́tiṣṭhipat is tr. by most as ‘cause enduring pain’ vel sim., which is far from the lit. meaning of the lexeme. The caus. to ā́√sthā sometimes means ‘make stand still’, and I think that sense is in play here. The horse is about to go on a journey (apiyántam ‘going along’ in pāda a; more fully described in 21b), but various mishaps can keep that journey from happening and make the horse stop.</p>
