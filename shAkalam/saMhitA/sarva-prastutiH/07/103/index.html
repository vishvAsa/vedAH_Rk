Frogs
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 1
A rain charm, which cleverly matches accurate description of frogs noisily emerging from estivation and mating at the beginning of the rainy season with the behavior of priests at a particular ritual, the Pravargya (see esp. vss. 7–9). Although there has been much debate about whether this hymn satirizes priests by comparing them to frogs or instead is to be taken with deadly seriousness, the truth no doubt lies somewhere in between. The poet obviously took great delight in his skill at match
ing frog behavior with ritual behavior and is unlikely to have been unaware of the potentially comic aspects of the comparison; however, the explosive fertility of the frogs provides a model for similar increase in the human sphere, and therefore the comparison has a serious purpose.
Attention to modern studies of animal behavior allows us to see just how much careful observation of frogs lies behind the depiction of the frogs here, and understanding anuran mating habits deepens our understanding of the poem. (See Jamison 1993.) For example, the frog lying “like a dried-out leather bag” is a coun
terintuitively accurate representation of a frog in estivation: some really do go dor mant and dry up during the dry season, and “adding water” plumps them up and revives them. Once revived, the chorus of frogs begins, the purpose of which is to draw female frogs to the males, who are vocalizing, for mating. This antiphonal chorus is described in verses 2–6. Since the calls of different species are quite dis tinctive (as sketched in vs. 6), the different cries serve to attract conspecific females to the appropriate male. The actual mating posture of frogs is described in verse 4: it involves the male approaching the female from behind and grasping her firmly for as long as it takes—which for some species can be quite awhile (days or weeks).
Another important aspect of the hymn is its comparison of the frog chorus to a pedagogical situation (see esp. vss. 3, 5), in which the father/teacher speaks and the pupils exactly repeat his utterance. This is the clearest and earliest depiction of pedagogy in ancient India and is an example of how our knowledge of everyday life at that time must be obliquely won. The most famous word in this hymn is found in verse 3, the phonologically aberrant akhkhala (underlying the so-called cvi-formation, akhkhalī-[kŕ̥tya]). On the one hand, it would take a very austere interpreter, and a killjoy, not to recognize this as an onomatopoetic imitation of a froggy sound; on the other hand, in the inspired analysis of Paul Thieme (1954), this is, in Middle Indic guise, a representation of the word akṣara “syllable.” What the frog pupils are doing is “making syllables,” that is, repeating the utterance of the teacher verbatim, as sound, not meaning. This is a pedagogical technique that endures to this day in traditional Vedic learning. It is also telling that the word akhkhala is in Middle Indic form, as the everyday language of the R̥gvedic poets, and especially of their wives and children, had most likely already undergone many of the phonological and morphological changes characteristic of Middle Indic, but only found in preserved texts from a much later period. Instruction of the young, as well as most ordinary conversation, was no doubt carried out in this language rather than in the high Vedic Sanskrit of the hymns.
As for the ritual application, the Pravargya rite occurs after a year-long con secration, like that referred to in verse 1 and brought to an end in verses 7–9. The most salient feature of the Pravargya is the offering of the gharma drink, referred to specifically in verses 8–9, the heated milk-offering that boils until it overflows. The last, and most important, implicit comparison between frogs and priests turns on this ritual offering: the prodigious discharge of eggs after anuran mating, especially by many pairs simultaneously, must have reminded the poet of the frothy bubbling overflow of the boiling milk. And since the thousands of eggs released are a tan gible sign of fertility and increase, the frogs are seen as assuring increase for us as well, in the final verse (10), culminating in the “Pressing of Thousands.”
Oldenberg suggests that that this hymn was added at this point in the Maṇḍala, just after the two Parjanya hymns (VII.101–2), because of the presence of Parjanya in the first verse. It is certainly appropriate for the rainy season.">

Frogs<br>
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi<br>
10 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 1<br>
A rain charm, which cleverly matches accurate description of frogs noisily emerging  from estivation and mating at the beginning of the rainy season with the behavior  of priests at a particular ritual, the Pravargya (see esp. vss. 7–9). Although there  has been much debate about whether this hymn satirizes priests by comparing them  to frogs or instead is to be taken with deadly seriousness, the truth no doubt lies  somewhere in between. The poet obviously took great delight in his skill at match<br>
ing frog behavior with ritual behavior and is unlikely to have been unaware of the  potentially comic aspects of the comparison; however, the explosive fertility of the  frogs provides a model for similar increase in the human sphere, and therefore the  comparison has a serious purpose.<br>
Attention to modern studies of animal behavior allows us to see just how  much careful observation of frogs lies behind the depiction of the frogs here, and  understanding anuran mating habits deepens our understanding of the poem. (See  Jamison 1993.) For example, the frog lying “like a dried-out leather bag” is a coun<br>
terintuitively accurate representation of a frog in estivation: some really do go dor mant and dry up during the dry season, and “adding water” plumps them up and  revives them. Once revived, the chorus of frogs begins, the purpose of which is to  draw female frogs to the males, who are vocalizing, for mating. This antiphonal  chorus is described in verses 2–6. Since the calls of different species are quite dis tinctive (as sketched in vs. 6), the different cries serve to attract conspecific females  to the appropriate male. The actual mating posture of frogs is described in verse  4: it involves the male approaching the female from behind and grasping her firmly  for as long as it takes—which for some species can be quite awhile (days or weeks).<br>
Another important aspect of the hymn is its comparison of the frog chorus to  a pedagogical situation (see esp. vss. 3, 5), in which the father/teacher speaks and  the pupils exactly repeat his utterance. This is the clearest and earliest depiction of  pedagogy in ancient India and is an example of how our knowledge of everyday  life at that time must be obliquely won. The most famous word in this hymn is  found in verse 3, the phonologically aberrant akhkhala (underlying the so-called  cvi-formation, akhkhalī-[kŕ̥tya]). On the one hand, it would take a very austere  interpreter, and a killjoy, not to recognize this as an onomatopoetic imitation of a  froggy sound; on the other hand, in the inspired analysis of Paul Thieme (1954),  this is, in Middle Indic guise, a representation of the word akṣara “syllable.” What  the frog pupils are doing is “making syllables,” that is, repeating the utterance of  the teacher verbatim, as sound, not meaning. This is a pedagogical technique that  endures to this day in traditional Vedic learning. It is also telling that the word  akhkhala is in Middle Indic form, as the everyday language of the R̥gvedic poets,  and especially of their wives and children, had most likely already undergone many of the phonological and morphological changes characteristic of Middle Indic, but  only found in preserved texts from a much later period. Instruction of the young,  as well as most ordinary conversation, was no doubt carried out in this language  rather than in the high Vedic Sanskrit of the hymns.<br>
As for the ritual application, the Pravargya rite occurs after a year-long con secration, like that referred to in verse 1 and brought to an end in verses 7–9. The  most salient feature of the Pravargya is the offering of the gharma drink, referred to  specifically in verses 8–9, the heated milk-offering that boils until it overflows. The  last, and most important, implicit comparison between frogs and priests turns on  this ritual offering: the prodigious discharge of eggs after anuran mating, especially  by many pairs simultaneously, must have reminded the poet of the frothy bubbling  overflow of the boiling milk. And since the thousands of eggs released are a tan gible sign of fertility and increase, the frogs are seen as assuring increase for us as  well, in the final verse (10), culminating in the “Pressing of Thousands.”<br>
Oldenberg suggests that that this hymn was added at this point in the Maṇḍala,  just after the two Parjanya hymns (VII.101–2), because of the presence of Parjanya  in the first verse. It is certainly appropriate for the rainy season.</p>

<p>Frogs 134 My interpr. of this hymn relies on the treatment of it in my 1993 article “Natural History Notes on the Rigvedic &lsquo;Frog&rsquo; Hymn,” Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 72-73 (1991-92 [1993]) [=Amṛtamahotsava Volume, for 75th anniversary of the BORI], pp. 137-44. Since this article is not universally accessible, I will reproduce much of the commentary here (without particular ref. to pg. nos. or to the sec. lit. that is excerpted there). The hymn is one of the most popular in the RV and has been constantly tr. &ndash; e.g., besides the usual, Macdonell (VRS and Hymns …), Renou (Hymnes spéculatifs), Thieme (Gedichte), Maurer, Doniger.</p>

<p>“The frogs, like <strong>Brāhmaṇas</strong>, observant of their vows, practising penance throughout the year, utteraloud praises agreeable to <strong>Parjanya</strong>.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vasiṣṭha</strong>, having praised Parjanya, in order to procure rain, observing thefrogs to be delighted by his praises, addressed them in this hymn. Practising penance = lit. lying still, i.e.performing penance for rain</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>Having lain still for a year, (like) brahmins following their<br>
commandment,<br>
the frogs have spoken forth a speech quickened by Parjanya.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>This first vs. is in Anuṣṭubh, as opposed to the rest of the hymn, which is Triṣṭubh, and it reads like a scene-setting introduction. Oldenberg suggests that it’s an addition.</p>
<p>The natural history phenomenon corresponding to the “year-long vow” (saṃvatsarám … vrata-[cāríṇaḥ]) undertaken by the frogs is surely estivation, as was already suggested by H. H. Bender in 1917 (“On the Naturalistic Background of the ‘Frog-Hymn,’ RV VII. 103,” JAOS 37: 186-91). The rains (here embodied in Parjanya) trigger the emergence of the frogs, in a frenzy to mate—what is known as “explosive breeding.” A loud chorus of male vocalizations attends the mating, calling females to the breeding place.</p>
<p>The pf. of √śi ‘lie’ is represented in Vedic only by the med. part. śasayāná-, found twice in the RV (also V.78.9). It has full-grade for expected zero-grade in the root syllable, matching the full-grade forms of the archaic root pres. śáye, part.</p>
<p>śáyāna-.</p>
<p>The presence of the stem brāhmaṇá- is of course a sign of the lateness of this hymn, since it is restricted to only the latest layer of the RV.</p>
<p>I now think the phrase brāhmaṇā́vratacāríṇaḥ “(like) brahmins following their commandment” may be a sly reference to brahmacárya- (first found in the AV, but cf. brahmacārín- in late RV X.109.5), which refers not only to the studentship phase of life stages, but also, specifically, to celibacy. The frogs, by virtue of their estivating state of suspended animation, have perforce been celibate, but they now go about energetically remedying the situation.</p>
<p>The phrase vā́cam … prá √vad is reminiscent of nearby VII.101.1 tisró vā́caḥ prá vada in a hymn to Parjanya, who is the instigator of the frogs’ speech here.</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The comparison of the estivating frog to a “dried-out leather bag” (dṛ́tiṃ ná śúṣkam) may reflect a natural phenomenon: a 1932 “Notes on Indian Batrachians” by one C. McCann in the Bombay Journal of Natural History recounts an experiment undertaken by him that involved depriving frogs of water until they became shrunken and dried out like pieces of wood and then rehydrating them, at which point they began behaving normally.</p>
<p>It is difficult to interpr. sarasī́as anything but a loc., but its morphology is a bit problematic. To the well-attested -s-stem sáras- ‘pond’, the loc. sg. is the expected sárasi (IX.97.52), but our form not only shows an unusual ending with a long ī, but it also bears the accent. No other forms to a putative stem sarasī́- (so Grassmann, 135 etc.) are found. Wackernagel-Debrunner (AiG II.1.306; II.2.384) also posit a sarasī́- stem, a vṛkī-type fem. with collective meaning, with loc. sg. in -ī́(AiG III.170; see also Lanman, Noun Inflection, 389), by way of a contraction of *sarasí y</p>
<p>-i. Though
vṛkī́-loc. sgs. are rare, see nadī́(I.135.9) and gaurī́(IX.12.3) to better established vṛkī́-stems. On balance, it seems best to posit a stem sarasī́- with Grassmann, Lanman, Oldenberg, Wackernagel-Debrunner, etc., but I do so reluctantly because of its extreme isolation and the widespread attestation of the -as-stem sáras-.</p>

saying “akhkhala” [/repeating syllables] like a son to a father (at<br>
lessons), one goes up close to the other who is speaking.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>This vs. contains the famous hapax akhkhalīkṛ́tya with the otherwise nonoccurring (in Skt.) cluster -khkh-. The word was brilliantly explained by Thieme (KZ [1951] 109 = KlSch 138). He sees it as the first attested cvi formation in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>The base noun is akṣára- ‘syllable’, and the sense would be ‘making syllables’ &ndash; a reference to the Indian pedagogical technique, still in use today in traditional instruction, of students repeating the text after the teacher, syllable by syllable, word by word. Here the teacher would be the father, as was most likely the original situation &ndash; hence pitáraṃ ná putráḥ “like a son to his father.” Since even in RVic times the language used in instructing young boys would surely have been an early form of Middle Indo-Aryan, it would not be surprising that this technical pedagogical term should appear in MIA garb: akṣára should yield *akkhara- in early MIA &ndash; and in fact does; cf. Pāli akkhara-. This has simply been transformed into the more “froggy” sounding *akhkhara- à akhkharī- in the cvi formation. This onomatopoetic rendering of a frog call is worthy to take its place beside the better known imitation in Aristophanes’s brekekekex koax koax. In fact, because the word does double duty in this passage &ndash; imitating frog vocalizations directly, while implicitly comparing the frog chorus to the call-and-response style of childhood instruction &ndash; our word seems even more ingenious and well chosen than the Greek. And it is quite striking that both the Greek and the Sanskrit immediately convince as froggy, though they are phonologically very distant from each other.</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“One of these two congratulates the other as they are both delighting in the forthcoming of rain; thespeckled frog, leaping up repeatedly when moistened (by the shower), joins greetings with the green one.”</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>One of the two grasps the other from behind, when they have become  exhilarated in the discharge of the waters,<br>
when the frog, rained upon, has hopped and hopped, and the speckled  one mixes his speech with the green one.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The verb in the first pāda, ánu gṛbhṇāti, is generally rendered with an anodyne ‘greet’ (Macdonell, Maurer, Doniger; sim. Renou ‘salue’), ‘support’ (unterstützt, Geldner), or is given a specifically ritual interpr. (Thieme, Gedichte). But the lexeme has a straightforward literal sense ‘grasp in following, grasp from behind’, and this literal meaning exactly describes the posture of frog mating (“amplexus”), with the male grasping the female around her middle with his forefeet (sometimes facilitated by so-called “nuptial pads” developed during the mating season). Since once achieved, this posture is held for long periods—hours, days, even weeks or months—it would be visually salient to any Vedic bard outdoors during the rainy season, which is also the frog mating season. The only potential problem with my interpr. is that the obj. of the verb is masc. anyám. However, the expression here anyó anyám “the one … the other” is already stereotypical in the RV for any mutual activity and will soon be frozen as the adverb anyonyam ‘mutually’. Moreover it is not impossible that the original text had a fem. *anyā́m (anyó *anyā́m ánu gṛbhṇāti enoḥ): four-syllable openings almost always have a heavy fourth syllable (see Arnold, 136 188), whereas the transmitted text has a light one. Thus *anyā́m could have been changed redactionally to anyám on the basis of the later adverb.</p>
<p>Note the phonetic echo … ámandiṣātām / maṇḍū́kaḥ.</p>
<p>The intens. kániṣkan in c, ‘hopped and hopped, continually hopped’, is a nice description of the apparently random and chaotic “scramble competition” of male frogs seeking partners.</p>

<p>Each of these twain receives the other kindly, while they are revelling in the flow of waters,<br>
When the Frog moistened by the rain springs forward, and Green and Spotty both combine their voices.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Macdonell</summary>
<p>The one of them the other hails with welcome, When in the flow of waters they have revelled; When rained upon the frogs become exultant, He that is Spotty joins his voice to Tawny&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>“When one of you imitates the croaking of another as a learner (imitates) his teacher, when, loud crying,you converse (leaping) upon the waters, then the enire body is as it were developed.”</p>

<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>During the dry weather,the frogs shrink like a lump of clay; in the rains they expand to their full size</p>

<p>Once one of them speaks the speech of the other, like a pupil that of his  teacher,<br>
(then) a whole section of them speaks as if in unison, when you of good  speech speak amid the waters.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The pedagogical model seen in vs. 3 is made more explicit here: the repetition of one frog’s call by another is likened to that of a pupil and his teacher (śāktásyeva … śikṣamāṇaḥ).</p>
<p>With Maurer, I take sárvam … párva as referring to a group of frogs, not to the section of a lesson with most others.</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The first ritual application is that of the Atirātra or “Overnight” soma ritual. Frogs are generally nocturnal; they are active during the day only if the weather is rainy or very humid. So, the first signal to humans of the frogs’ emergence from estivation would be the sound of the nocturnal frog chorus when the rain supplied them with the impetus to emerge. Hence they are compared to brahmins at an Overnight ritual speaking around a soma vessel configured as a pond.</p>
<p>The similes are complexly intertwined: the frogs are compared to brahmins, but those hypothetical brahmins are then implicitly compared to frogs around a pond - in other words to the original target of comparison.</p>

<p>The brahmins, having soma, have made speech, creating their yearly  sacred formulation.<br>
The Adhvaryus, having the hot ritual milk-drink (at the Pravargya<br>
ritual), sweating, become visible; none are hidden.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>But as the day dawns, the frogs become visible, with their drive to mate overriding any instinct to flee or conceal themselves. This visibility is insistently conveyed by “[they] become visible; none are hidden” (āvír bhavanti gúhyā ná ké cit).</p>
<p>The frogs are compared to two different kinds of priests: brahmins (7a, 8a), who are here responsible for ritual speech, and Adhvaryus (8c), the priests who do the physical labor in Vedic ritual. They are “sweating” (siṣvidānā́ḥ): sweat is a sign of hard ritual labor in Indo-Iranian religious terminology (see my 2011 [2015] “Avestan xšuuīd: A Relic of Indo-Iranian Ritual Vocabulary,” Bulletin of the Asia Institute 25: 19-29). Here, once again the image does double duty &ndash; the frogs would be covered with water drops from the rains, but they are also compared to the hard-working priests officiating at the Pravargya ritual. The Pravargya is an especially sweatinducing ritual, since it involves a hot milk drink (gharmá-), which must be tended as it is heated over the fire. Other features of the Pravargya conform to aspects of the hymn: there is a year-long dīkṣā (period of consecration for the sacrificer), reflected 137 in both 1a (saṃvatsaráṃ śaśayānā́ḥ “lying for a year”) and 8b (bráhma kṛṇvántaḥ parivatsarī́ṇam “creating their yearly sacred formulation”); this dīkṣā involves a taboo on water or moisture of any kind. But the most crucial intersection between the Pravargya and frog behavior is found in the next vs. Note in passing the non-etym. figure vā́cam akrata bráhma kṛṇvántaḥ with two forms of √kṛ governing two words for speech, with the subject, brāhmaṇā́saḥ in a derivational relationship to the 2nd form of speech.</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“These leaders of rites observe the instrumental tutes of the gods and disregard not the (appropriate) season ofthe twelve month; as the year revolves, and the rains return then, scorched and heated, they obtain freedom(from their hiding- plural ces).”</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>They guarded the godly establishment of the twelve(-month); these men  do not confound the season.<br>
In a year, when the rainy season has come, the heated ritual milk-drinks  obtain their own release.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The year-long preparation for the Pravargya rite is again emphasized here in the first three pādas.</p>
<p>In b the ná is potentially ambiguous. The first reading is no doubt the negative: the ritualists/frogs do not fail to observe the proper ritual calendar. The VP ná (…) (prá) minanti is quite common (e.g., II.24.12, III.28.4, X.10.5). But ná could also be a simile marker in the phrase náro ná, for, after all, the subjects are frogs, compared to men. Since ná occupies the fifth syllable of the pāda, either reading is compatible with its position: an early caesura, followed by ná, for the negative reading; a late caesura, preceded by ná, for the simile.</p>
<p>The final pāda of the vs. is the ritual climax: the gharmá-drinks, heated on the fire, bubble up and overflow their vessel, as milk does when it’s been left too long on the stove. The “obtain their own release” (aśnuvate visargám, note the middle verb), a phrase rendered rather generically by many tr. (e.g., Doniger “the hot fires come to an end”; Maurer “the heated receptacles get emptied out”), is in my view a rendering of the dramatic moment when the bubbling mass boils over. I further suggest that its analogue in the natural world is the female frog’s release of her masses of eggs (up to 2000+ in some species), which are fertilized by the male as they are released - which must be a visually striking event. It may also refer to the practice of some frogs of making a “foam nest” in which to deposit the eggs, liquid albumen whipped up by the frog’s hind legs into a “dense light foam” &ndash; a process that also might appear like milk boiling over.</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“May the cow-toned, the goat-toned, the speckled, the green (frog, severally) grant us riches! May thefrogs in the fertilizing (season of the rain), bestowing upon us hundreds of cows, prolong (our) lives!”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>In thefertilizing season of the rain: sahasrasāve = the genitive rator of thousands of plural nts, grains and the like</p>
</details>

<p>The one with a cow’s bellow has given, the one with a goat’s bleat has  given, the speckled one has given, the green one (has given) us goods. The frogs, giving hundred of cows, lengthened (their/our) life at a<br>
“Pressing of Thousands.”</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The frogs’ release and fertilization of masses of eggs in the preceding vs. serves as a model for the fertility and increase of the ritualists that are major aims in Vedic rituals. This is surely the sense conveyed by the final vs. of the hymn, describing various types of frogs as “giving” goods and hundreds of cows to us, as well as lengthening both their and our lifetimes. They do so “at a pressing of thousands,” which can literally refer to the release of the frogs’ eggs. The prodigious fertility of frogs (no matter what happens subsequent to the thousands of eggs produced) is an encouragement to our own..</p>
<p>The published translation renders prá tiranta ā́yuḥ as “they lengthened (their / our) life.” But the verb is of course tirante, a present indic., out of sandhi and the tr. should be corrected to “lengthen.”</p>

<p>Cow-bellow and Goat-bleat have granted riches, and Green and Spotty have vouchsafed us treasure.<br>
The Frogs who give us cows in hundreds lengthen our lives in this most fertilizing season.</p>

<details><summary>आर्यमुनि - भावार्थः</summary>
<p>भावार्थभाषाः -  परमात्मा उपदेश करते हैं कि हे जीवो ! तुम वर्षाकाल से अनन्त प्रकार की शिक्षा का लाभ करो और अपने ऐश्वर्य और आयु की वृद्धि की प्रार्थना करो। यद्यपि केवल प्रार्थना से ऐश्वर्य और आयु की वृद्धि नहीं होती, तथापि जिसके हृदय में आयुर्वृद्धि और ऐश्वर्यवृद्धि का भाव उत्पन्न होता है, वह उसकी प्राप्ति के लिये यज्ञ अवश्य करता है। इस नियम के अनुसार परमात्मा ने जीवों को प्रार्थना का उपदेश प्रधानरूप से दिया है, अस्तु। मुख्य प्रसङ्ग यह है कि वर्षाऋतु का वर्णन इस सूक्त से भलीभाँति किया गया है और वर्षाऋतु का मण्डन करनेवाले मण्डूकादि जीवों की रचना से शिक्षालाभ का उपदेश इस सूक्त का तात्पर्य है। जो लोग यह कहा करते हैं कि वेद में ऐसे भी सूक्त हैं, जिनके मण्डूक देवता हैं, उनको यह समझ लेना चाहिये कि मण्डूक देवता होना कोई निन्दा की बात नहीं, वेदों के महत्त्व की बात है, क्योंकि जब देवता शब्द के अर्थ यह हैं कि ‘दीव्यतीति देवः’ जो प्रकाश करे, तो क्या मण्डूक किसी विद्या का प्रकाश नहीं करते, यदि न करते तो बाईआलोजी विद्या में मण्डूकादि जन्तुओं की आवश्यकता क्यों पड़ती ? इससे स्पष्ट सिद्ध है कि परमात्मा ने सब विद्याओं का मूलभूत बीज वेद में पहले से ही रख दिया है। दूसरी बात यह है कि यदि वेद में वर्षाऋतु का वर्णन न होता, तो कवि लोग कहाँ से इसका वर्णन करते। सच तो यह है कि जिस सौन्दर्य के साथ इस सूक्त में वर्षाऋतु का वर्णन किया है, उस सौन्दर्य्य के साथ आदिकवि वाल्मीकि भी वर्षाऋतु को वर्णन नहीं कर सके। इससे अधिक वेदों का महत्त्व और क्या हो सकता है कि सबसे उत्तम साहित्य और सर्वोपरि पदार्थविद्या का वर्णन वेद के अनेक सूक्तों में पाया जाता है ॥१०॥ यह १०३वाँ सूक्त और चौथा वर्ग समाप्त हुआ ॥</p>
