Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
This intricate and justly admired hymn has been widely anthologized and stud ied. See especially the treatment of the hymn in Jamison (2007: 103–8) and Lüders (1951: 315–21). It is closely related to the two preceding hymns and likewise con cerns the relationship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, delineating it in perhaps the most intimate fashion of any of these hymns.
Vasiṣṭha speaks for himself in these verses, even though he begins in verse 1 by addressing himself in the vocative. Once again, the theme of the poem is the distance between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa that has been created by something that Vasiṣṭha has done. That Vasiṣṭha addresses himself in the 2nd person perhaps suggests not only his distance from the god but even, as a result, from himself. The meaning of this becomes clearer as the poem develops. In verse 2 Vasiṣṭha approaches the ritual fire during the night and in the face of fire sees the face of Varuṇa. This results in a vision of Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa sailing together (vs. 3). Their goal is Varuṇa’s “swing,” which, as in VII.87.5, is probably the sun, which Vasiṣṭha hopes will dispel the dark ness that surrounds him and his relationship with Varuṇa. This vision takes Vasiṣṭha back to the time when he and Varuṇa were close (vs. 4), when Varuṇa made Vasiṣṭha a seer (ŕ̥ṣi) and praise singer (stotár). The light imagery is most intense in this verse, for the day Vasiṣṭha became a seer and praise singer was the “brightest day of days.” This memory of a time of perfect harmony between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa is the dra matic and emotional climax of the hymn and not surprisingly occupies the central
verse of the hymn, which like the two previous hymns has an omphalos structure. In verse 5 Vasiṣṭha returns from his vision and memory of better times to the unhappy present, in which he is no longer in the household of Varuṇa. But in verse 6 he continues to hope that, despite what he has done, the god will not hold his offenses against him, and will again offer him the protection that he once enjoyed within the house of Varuṇa. The poet keeps these offenses distant from himself by talking about the offender in the 3rd person (in 6ab), but then he refers to those who bear the guilt of those offenses in the 1st person (in 6c). Finally, in verse 7 the poet more confidently looks to Varuṇa’s forgiveness: he “will release his fetter” of punishment “from us.” As Jamison (2007: 107) has pointed out, both pādas a and c have present participles for which there is no grammatically appropriate noun. Logically they should describe “us”—and that logic is reflected in the translation— but the absence of an explicit reference to us generalizes that happy result and the possibility of reconciliation with the god.">

Varuṇa<br>
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi<br>
7 verses: triṣṭubh<br>
This intricate and justly admired hymn has been widely anthologized and stud ied. See especially the treatment of the hymn in Jamison (2007: 103–8) and Lüders  (1951: 315–21). It is closely related to the two preceding hymns and likewise con cerns the relationship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, delineating it in perhaps the  most intimate fashion of any of these hymns.<br>
Vasiṣṭha speaks for himself in these verses, even though he begins in verse 1 by  addressing himself in the vocative. Once again, the theme of the poem is the distance  between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa that has been created by something that Vasiṣṭha has  done. That Vasiṣṭha addresses himself in the 2nd person perhaps suggests not only  his distance from the god but even, as a result, from himself. The meaning of this  becomes clearer as the poem develops. In verse 2 Vasiṣṭha approaches the ritual fire  during the night and in the face of fire sees the face of Varuṇa. This results in a  vision of Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa sailing together (vs. 3). Their goal is Varuṇa’s “swing,”  which, as in VII.87.5, is probably the sun, which Vasiṣṭha hopes will dispel the dark ness that surrounds him and his relationship with Varuṇa. This vision takes Vasiṣṭha  back to the time when he and Varuṇa were close (vs. 4), when Varuṇa made Vasiṣṭha  a seer (ŕ̥ṣi) and praise singer (stotár). The light imagery is most intense in this verse, for the day Vasiṣṭha became a seer and praise singer was the “brightest day of days.”  This memory of a time of perfect harmony between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa is the dra matic and emotional climax of the hymn and not surprisingly occupies the central<br>
verse of the hymn, which like the two previous hymns has an omphalos structure. In verse 5 Vasiṣṭha returns from his vision and memory of better times to the  unhappy present, in which he is no longer in the household of Varuṇa. But in verse  6 he continues to hope that, despite what he has done, the god will not hold his  offenses against him, and will again offer him the protection that he once enjoyed  within the house of Varuṇa. The poet keeps these offenses distant from himself by  talking about the offender in the 3rd person (in 6ab), but then he refers to those  who bear the guilt of those offenses in the 1st person (in 6c). Finally, in verse 7 the  poet more confidently looks to Varuṇa’s forgiveness: he “will release his fetter” of  punishment “from us.” As Jamison (2007: 107) has pointed out, both pādas a and  c have present participles for which there is no grammatically appropriate noun.  Logically they should describe “us”—and that logic is reflected in the translation— but the absence of an explicit reference to us generalizes that happy result and the  possibility of reconciliation with the god.</p>
