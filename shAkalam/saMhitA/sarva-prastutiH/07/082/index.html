Indra and Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: jagatī
This hymn is structured into two sections, with the second embedded in the first. The first is an invocation to Indra and Varuṇa to come to the rite and consists of verses 1 and 7–10. The second section and the heart of the hymn are verses 2–6, which describe the two sides of kingship that the two gods represent.
Indra represents the king ruling during times of migration and conflict; Varuṇa represents the king ruling during times of settlement, ideally times of peace. In the984 VII.82
political structure of the Vedic period, different men may have been kings during these two times or, as we believe more likely, the same king may have exercised these complementary functions at different times of the year.
In verse 2 the poet calls one of the gods samrā́j “sovereign king” and the other svarā́j “independent king.” While both terms can be used of both Indra and Varuṇa (cf. Schlerath 1960: 132–35), samrā́j is used especially frequently of Varuṇa and the Ādityas (cf. I.25.10; V.63.3, 85.1; VIII.25.7–8, 29.9, 42.1; X.63.5) and svarā́j frequently of Indra (cf. I.61.9; III.45.5; VIII.12.14, 46.28, 61.2, 69.17, 93.11). Therefore, despite Schlerath’s doubts, the “sovereign king” here is likely Varuṇa and the “independent king” Indra. Further, at least in this verse, the contrasting titles likely reflect the distribution of kingly functions between the two gods. Since the samrā́j governed the peoples and their divisions, he might be connected with times of settlement. Since the svarā́j was independent of other authority, he might be associated with times of conflict between separate clans, peoples, and rulers.
However the relation between svarā́j and samrā́j is to be understood, the poet insists on the necessity of both kinds of king and both sides of kingship. Indeed, after contrasting the two gods in verse 2ab, the poet emphasizes their similarity (2cd) and their united action in ordering the world (3ab). In verse 3cd the actions of the ritual are blended with the gods’ cosmic functions. The two gods share Soma— here both the ritual drink and the god—who inspires their action and who therefore metonymically possesses the transforming power, the “cunning” (māyā́), by which they made the waters swell. The image of swelling waters is then metaphorically carried over to the hymns, which should likewise swell.
In verse 4 the poet returns to the two periods associated with the two sides of king ship: in 4a the poet and his people are moving in chariots at the time of conflict and migration; in 4b they are seated at the beginning of the period of settlement. But here, unlike verse 2ab, the poet does not explicitly distinguish between the two gods. Both gods are summoned at both times. In verse 5cd, however, he reintroduces their oppo sition by connecting Varuṇa with settlement and Indra with movement. This alterna tion between conjunctions and disjunctions underscores the mutual dependence of the different sides of kingship and the poet’s insistence that both gods are great.
Verse 6 continues the contrast between Indra and Varuṇa in a fashion similar to verse 2, although the actions of the gods in 6cd are not entirely clear. Assuming that 6c refers to the action of Indra and possibly to the destruction of Vr̥tra and similar “obstacles,” then 6d describes the action of Varuṇa. As Renou (EVP VII: 83) notes, the verb prá √vR̥in 6d is rare, but appears to mean “ward off” the attack of an enemy (cf. IX.21.2). Unlike the aggressive action of Indra in 6c, the action of Varuṇa is thus defensive. Perhaps he protects the individual settlements during times of peace from incursions from enemies who might threaten them. The two gods thus have complementary functions in their different contexts and the similarity between them is reflected in the singular ójas “power” (6b) that both possess.
In verse 1 the poet is especially aware that his is not the most elaborate sacrifice offered, but he asks the gods to ignore what he sees as the overly showy rites of his competitors and to come to his rite. While it may be plainer than other rites, it does not have the evil intent behind it that those rites have. Returning to this theme in the latter part of the hymn, verses 7–10, the poet pleads for the attention of Indra and Varuṇa. In verse 9 he recalls the competition for the gods’ favor and again asks the gods to hear his words, for his sacrifice will please the gods more than the words and rites of others.">

Indra and Varuṇa<br>
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi<br>
10 verses: jagatī<br>
This hymn is structured into two sections, with the second embedded in the first.  The first is an invocation to Indra and Varuṇa to come to the rite and consists of  verses 1 and 7–10. The second section and the heart of the hymn are verses 2–6,  which describe the two sides of kingship that the two gods represent.<br>
Indra represents the king ruling during times of migration and conflict; Varuṇa  represents the king ruling during times of settlement, ideally times of peace. In the984 VII.82<br>
political structure of the Vedic period, different men may have been kings during  these two times or, as we believe more likely, the same king may have exercised these  complementary functions at different times of the year.<br>
In verse 2 the poet calls one of the gods samrā́j “sovereign king” and the other  svarā́j “independent king.” While both terms can be used of both Indra and Varuṇa  (cf. Schlerath 1960:  132–35), samrā́j is used especially frequently of Varuṇa and  the Ādityas (cf. I.25.10; V.63.3, 85.1; VIII.25.7–8, 29.9, 42.1; X.63.5) and svarā́j frequently of Indra (cf. I.61.9; III.45.5; VIII.12.14, 46.28, 61.2, 69.17, 93.11).  Therefore, despite Schlerath’s doubts, the “sovereign king” here is likely Varuṇa  and the “independent king” Indra. Further, at least in this verse, the contrasting  titles likely reflect the distribution of kingly functions between the two gods. Since  the samrā́j governed the peoples and their divisions, he might be connected with  times of settlement. Since the svarā́j was independent of other authority, he might  be associated with times of conflict between separate clans, peoples, and rulers.<br>
However the relation between svarā́j and samrā́j is to be understood, the poet  insists on the necessity of both kinds of king and both sides of kingship. Indeed,  after contrasting the two gods in verse 2ab, the poet emphasizes their similarity  (2cd) and their united action in ordering the world (3ab). In verse 3cd the actions of  the ritual are blended with the gods’ cosmic functions. The two gods share Soma— here both the ritual drink and the god—who inspires their action and who therefore  metonymically possesses the transforming power, the “cunning” (māyā́), by which  they made the waters swell. The image of swelling waters is then metaphorically  carried over to the hymns, which should likewise swell.<br>
In verse 4 the poet returns to the two periods associated with the two sides of king ship: in 4a the poet and his people are moving in chariots at the time of conflict and  migration; in 4b they are seated at the beginning of the period of settlement. But here,  unlike verse 2ab, the poet does not explicitly distinguish between the two gods. Both  gods are summoned at both times. In verse 5cd, however, he reintroduces their oppo sition by connecting Varuṇa with settlement and Indra with movement. This alterna tion between conjunctions and disjunctions underscores the mutual dependence of  the different sides of kingship and the poet’s insistence that both gods are great.<br>
Verse 6 continues the contrast between Indra and Varuṇa in a fashion similar to  verse 2, although the actions of the gods in 6cd are not entirely clear. Assuming that  6c refers to the action of Indra and possibly to the destruction of Vr̥tra and similar  “obstacles,” then 6d describes the action of Varuṇa. As Renou (EVP VII: 83) notes,  the verb prá √vR̥in 6d is rare, but appears to mean “ward off” the attack of an enemy  (cf. IX.21.2). Unlike the aggressive action of Indra in 6c, the action of Varuṇa is  thus defensive. Perhaps he protects the individual settlements during times of peace  from incursions from enemies who might threaten them. The two gods thus have  complementary functions in their different contexts and the similarity between  them is reflected in the singular ójas “power” (6b) that both possess.<br>
In verse 1 the poet is especially aware that his is not the most elaborate sacrifice  offered, but he asks the gods to ignore what he sees as the overly showy rites of his competitors and to come to his rite. While it may be plainer than other rites, it does  not have the evil intent behind it that those rites have. Returning to this theme in  the latter part of the hymn, verses 7–10, the poet pleads for the attention of Indra  and Varuṇa. In verse 9 he recalls the competition for the gods’ favor and again asks  the gods to hear his words, for his sacrifice will please the gods more than the words  and rites of others.</p>

<p>अब दुराधर्ष राजा की विभूति कथन करते हैं।</p>
</details>
<details><summary>आर्यमुनि - पदार्थः</summary>
<p>पदार्थान्वयभाषाः -  (यस्य) जिस राजा के (अध्वरं) यज्ञ को (देवा) शस्त्रास्त्रादिविद्यासम्पन्न विद्वान् (वीथः) संगत होकर (गच्छथः) जाते हैं, (तं) उस राजा को अथवा (मर्तस्य) मरणधर्मा मनुष्य को (परिह्वृतिः) कोई बाधा (नशते, न) नाश नहीं कर सकती और (न) नाही (कुतः, चन) किसी ओर से (तपः) कोई ताप उसका नाश कर सकता है, (मर्त्यम्) जिस मनुष्य को (इन्द्रावरुणा) विद्युत् तथा जलीय विद्या जाननेवाले विद्वान् प्राप्त होते हैं, (तं) उसको (न, अंहः) न कोई पाप (न, दुरितानि) न कोई दुष्कर्म नाश कर सकता है ॥७॥</p>
</details>
<details><summary>आर्यमुनि - भावार्थः</summary>
<p>भावार्थभाषाः -  परमात्मा उपदेश करते हैं कि हे राजा तथा यजमानो ! तुम लोग अस्त्रशस्त्रविद्यासम्पन्न विद्वानों को अपने यज्ञों में बुलाओ, क्योंकि वारुणास्त्र तथा आग्नेयास्त्र आदि अस्त्रविद्यावेत्ता विद्वान् जिस राजा वा यजमान के यज्ञ में जाते हैं अथवा जिनका उपर्युक्त विद्वानों से घनिष्ठ सम्बन्ध होता है, उनको न कोई ताप और न कोई अन्य बाधा नाश को प्राप्त कर सकती है। उनको न कोई शत्रु पीड़ा दे सकता और न कोई पाप उनका नाश कर सकता है अर्थात् विद्वानों के सत्सङ्ग से उनके पाप क्षय होकर जीवन पवित्र हो जाता है, इसलिए राजाओं को उचित है कि विद्वानों का सत्कार करते हुए उनको अपना समीपी बनावें, जिससे वे किसी विपत्ति को न देखें ॥७॥</p>
