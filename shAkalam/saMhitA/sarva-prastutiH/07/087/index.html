Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
On this hymn, see the introduction to the previous hymn and especially Jamison (2007: 101–3).
The name of Varuṇa occurs in each verse of the hymn, and in verse 4 Varuṇa himself speaks. Like the previous one, therefore, this hymn has an omphalos structure, organized around the central verse 4 and the words of the god himself. In hymns organized around a central verse, that verse is often the key to under
standing a hymn or the dramatic climax of the hymn, as it is, for example, in the previous hymn. But sometimes, as here, it is the most enigmatic verse of all. In 4a, as implied in the translation below, does Varuṇa know that the poet is wise and therefore will understand his cryptic words? Or does médhira “wise” anticipate the wisdom that the poet will receive from Varuṇa’s words? In that case, we might rather say that Varuṇa spoke “to me (to make me) wise”? As Jamison (2007: 102– 3) argues, the ambiguous placement of ná in 4c allows it to be taken either as a particle of comparison (“like”) or as a negation (“not”). As a result the pāda can mean either “he will speak (their names) like secrets,” that is, he will speak the names but he will do so only in a cryptic manner, or “he will not speak their secret (names),” that is, he will keep the secrets hidden. But most of all, there are the obscure words of the god in 4b: “The inviolable cow bears three times seven names.” As often, the “cow” in this verse is speech (e.g., Thompson 1995: 20), and it is speech, or more specifically this hymn, that carries within it twenty-one “names.” These names may be similar to the three times seven “tracks” (padā́) in I.72.6, although these tracks too are also “secret” (gúhyāni) and therefore their reference unclear.
There is one possible clue to the twenty-one names in the following verse. Verse 5 mentions three heavens and three earths “arranged in six” or “arranged in sixes.” That is, “six” could refer to the three heavens and three earths, and, if so, we should translate, “Three heavens are hidden within him, and below are three earths, form
ing an arrangement of six.” On the other hand, if ṣáḍvidhānāḥ refers only to the three earths and if each of the three earths is arranged in six, then we would have eighteen earths and three heavens, which gives twenty-one, the number of “names.” In that case, the “names” might be tokens of the extent of Varuṇa’s rule.
Returning again to verse 4, its last mystery is the “later generation” in 4d, which may refer not to a future generation of human beings but to humans as the “generation” of beings later than the gods. If so, then Varuṇa strives to instruct humans despite their limited capacities, perhaps well illustrated in our attempts to understand him.
While verse 4 is the most enigmatic in the hymn, it is not the only mysterious one. We have already touched on the riddle of three heavens and three earths of verse 5ab. In verse 6a Varuṇa is like the sky, which drops to the horizon at the far distance where there is the river that surrounds the earth. Because he is like the sky that drops toward this river, he is called a wild animal (6b) that comes down to the water to drink and he is like the “bright drop,” which, as Geldner points out, might be the setting moon or sun or even the soma as it sinks into the waters with which it is mixed. In 6c Varuṇa is “of deep recitation.” The primary sense is probably that Varuṇa speaks profound words, but the compound is ambiguous and could also mean that Varuṇa inspires or receives profound praise-recitations. Verse 7 connects this hymn to the previous hymn and provides a persuasive reason to link the two hymns, as Jamison (2007: 103) has noted. In VII.86.2 the poet asks, “When shall I be within Varuṇa?” Here in verse 7 the poet gives an answer: when we are free of offense, then “we would be within Varuṇa.” That is, we would be in conformity with the vratā́ny áditeḥ “the commandments of Aditi,” the goddess representing offense lessness, whose commandments are mentioned in 7c.">

Varuṇa<br>
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi<br>
7 verses: triṣṭubh<br>
On this hymn, see the introduction to the previous hymn and especially Jamison  (2007: 101–3).<br>
The name of Varuṇa occurs in each verse of the hymn, and in verse 4 Varuṇa  himself speaks. Like the previous one, therefore, this hymn has an omphalos  structure, organized around the central verse 4 and the words of the god himself.  In hymns organized around a central verse, that verse is often the key to under<br>
standing a hymn or the dramatic climax of the hymn, as it is, for example, in the  previous hymn. But sometimes, as here, it is the most enigmatic verse of all. In 4a,  as implied in the translation below, does Varuṇa know that the poet is wise and  therefore will understand his cryptic words? Or does médhira “wise” anticipate  the wisdom that the poet will receive from Varuṇa’s words? In that case, we might  rather say that Varuṇa spoke “to me (to make me) wise”? As Jamison (2007: 102– 3) argues, the ambiguous placement of ná in 4c allows it to be taken either as a  particle of comparison (“like”) or as a negation (“not”). As a result the pāda  can mean either “he will speak (their names) like secrets,” that is, he will speak  the names but he will do so only in a cryptic manner, or “he will not speak their  secret (names),” that is, he will keep the secrets hidden. But most of all, there are  the obscure words of the god in 4b: “The inviolable cow bears three times seven names.” As often, the “cow” in this verse is speech (e.g., Thompson 1995: 20),  and it is speech, or more specifically this hymn, that carries within it twenty-one  “names.” These names may be similar to the three times seven “tracks” (padā́) in  I.72.6, although these tracks too are also “secret” (gúhyāni) and therefore their  reference unclear.<br>
There is one possible clue to the twenty-one names in the following verse. Verse  5 mentions three heavens and three earths “arranged in six” or “arranged in sixes.”  That is, “six” could refer to the three heavens and three earths, and, if so, we should  translate, “Three heavens are hidden within him, and below are three earths, form<br>
ing an arrangement of six.” On the other hand, if ṣáḍvidhānāḥ refers only to the  three earths and if each of the three earths is arranged in six, then we would have  eighteen earths and three heavens, which gives twenty-one, the number of “names.”  In that case, the “names” might be tokens of the extent of Varuṇa’s rule.<br>
Returning again to verse 4, its last mystery is the “later generation” in 4d,  which may refer not to a future generation of human beings but to humans as the  “generation” of beings later than the gods. If so, then Varuṇa strives to instruct  humans despite their limited capacities, perhaps well illustrated in our attempts to  understand him.<br>
While verse 4 is the most enigmatic in the hymn, it is not the only mysterious  one. We have already touched on the riddle of three heavens and three earths of  verse 5ab. In verse 6a Varuṇa is like the sky, which drops to the horizon at the far  distance where there is the river that surrounds the earth. Because he is like the sky  that drops toward this river, he is called a wild animal (6b) that comes down to the  water to drink and he is like the “bright drop,” which, as Geldner points out, might  be the setting moon or sun or even the soma as it sinks into the waters with which  it is mixed. In 6c Varuṇa is “of deep recitation.” The primary sense is probably that  Varuṇa speaks profound words, but the compound is ambiguous and could also  mean that Varuṇa inspires or receives profound praise-recitations. Verse 7 connects  this hymn to the previous hymn and provides a persuasive reason to link the two  hymns, as Jamison (2007: 103) has noted. In VII.86.2 the poet asks, “When shall  I be within Varuṇa?” Here in verse 7 the poet gives an answer: when we are free of  offense, then “we would be within Varuṇa.” That is, we would be in conformity with  the vratā́ny áditeḥ “the commandments of Aditi,” the goddess representing offense lessness, whose commandments are mentioned in 7c.</p>

<p>भावार्थभाषाः -  “वृणोति सर्वमिति वरुणः”=जो इस चराचर ब्रह्माण्ड को अपनी शक्तिद्वारा आच्छादान करे, उसका नाम “वरुण” है। एकमात्र परमात्मा ही ऐसा महान् है, जो सब विश्ववर्ग को अपनी शक्तिद्वारा आच्छादन करके अपनी महत्ता से सर्वत्र ओत-प्रोत हो रहा है, इसलिए उसका नाम वरुण है, जैसा कि “ईशावास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किंच जगत्यां जगत्” यजु० ४०।१॥ इत्यादि मन्त्रों में अन्यत्र भी वर्णन किया है कि इस संसार में जो कुछ वस्तुमात्र दृष्टिगत हो रहा है, वह सब ईश्वर की सत्ता से व्याप्त है। यही भाव इस मन्त्र में प्रकारान्तर से वर्णन किया है कि वायु उस वरुण परमात्मा के प्राणसमान और यह निखिल ब्रहमाण्ड उसके स्थान हैं, जो जीवमात्र को प्रिय हैं ॥ तात्पर्य्य यह है कि परमात्मा की रचनारूप ये ब्रह्माण्ड ऐसे अद्भुत हैं कि जीवमात्र इनको अमृततुल्य मानते हुए आनन्दपूर्वक उपभोग करते हैं, परन्तु जो प्राणी उस परब्रह्म के आज्ञापालक हैं, उन्हीं को यह ब्रह्माण्ड सदैव अमृतमय प्रतीत होता है, इसी अभिप्राय से कहा है कि “आनन्दादेव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते, आनन्देन जातानि जीवन्ति” उसी आनन्दस्वरूप परमात्मा से ये सब प्राणी उत्पन्न होते और आनन्द से ही जीते हैं। अर्थात् जिस प्रकार सुषुप्ति अवस्था में जीव आनन्द का भोक्ता होता है, इसी प्रकार प्रलयावस्था में भी आनन्द का भोग करता है, इसका नाम प्रकृतिलय अवस्था है। इसमें और मुक्ति अवस्था में इतना भेद है कि इस अवस्था में आविद्यिक=अविद्या की वृत्ति बनी रहती है और मुक्ति अवस्था में यह वृत्ति नहीं होती। यद्यपि प्रलय और सुषुप्ति में आनन्द होता है, परन्तु वह मुक्ति के समान अविद्यारहित आनन्द नहीं होता। “आनन्दादेव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते०” मुक्त जीव आनन्द भोगते हुए ही इस संसार में आते और सदाचारी होने के कारण यहाँ भी आनन्द भोगते और अन्त में उसी चिद्घन आनन्दस्वरूप ब्रह्म में लय हो जाते हैं। इस प्रकार सदाचारपूर्वक परमात्मा की आज्ञापालन करनेवाले पुरुषों को यह संसार सदैव आनन्दमय होता है ॥२॥</p>

<p>अब परमात्मा निष्पाप होने का प्रकार कथन करते हैं।</p>
</details>
<details><summary>आर्यमुनि - पदार्थः</summary>
<p>पदार्थान्वयभाषाः -  (यः) जो परमात्मा (आगः, चक्रुषे) अपराध करते हुए को (चित्) भी (मृळयाति) अपनी दया से क्षमा कर देता है, उस (वरुणे) वरुणरूप परमात्मा के समक्ष (वयं) हम (अनागाः) निरपराध (स्याम) हों, (अदितेः) उस अखण्डनीय परमात्मा के (व्रतानि) नियमों को (अनु, ऋधन्तः) निरन्तर पालन करते हुए प्रार्थना करें कि हे परमात्मन् ! (यूयं) आप (स्वस्तिभिः) मङ्गलवाणियों से (सदा) सदैव (नः) हमारी (पात) रक्षा करें॥७॥</p>
</details>
<details><summary>आर्यमुनि - भावार्थः</summary>
<p>भावार्थभाषाः -  इस मन्त्र में जो यह वर्णन किया है कि वह अपराध करते हुए को अपनी दया से क्षमा कर देता है, इसका आशय यह है कि वह अपने सम्बन्ध में हुए पापों को क्षमा कर देता है, परन्तु जिन पापों का प्रभाव दूसरों पर पड़ता है, उनको कदापि क्षमा नहीं करता। जैसे कोई प्रमादवश किसी दिन सन्ध्या न करे, तो प्रार्थना करने पर उस पाप को क्षमा कर सकता है, परन्तु चोरी अथवा असत्य भाषणादि पापों को वह कदापि क्षमा नहीं करता, उनका दण्ड अवश्य देता है। यद्यपि परमात्मा में इतनी उदारता है कि वह अपराधों को क्षमा भी कर सकता है, परन्तु हमको उसके समक्ष सदैव निरपराध होकर जाना चाहिये। जब हम उस परमात्मा के नियमों का पालन करते हुए उससे क्षमा की प्रार्थना करते हैं, तभी वह हमारे ऊपर दया कर सकता है, अन्यथा नहीं ॥ इस मन्त्र में परमात्मा की आज्ञारूप व्रतों के पालन करने का सर्वोपरि उपदेश पाया जाता है, जैसा कि “अग्ने व्रतपते व्रतं चरिष्यामि०॥” यजु० १।५॥ इत्यादि मन्त्रों में व्रतपालन की प्रार्थना की गई है। जो पुरुष व्रतपालन नहीं कर सकता, उससे संसार में कुछ भी नहीं होता, उसका जीवन निष्फल जाता है, इसलिये ईश्वरीय नियमों का पालन करना प्रत्येक मनुष्य के लिये अवश्य कर्त्तव्य है ॥७॥ यह ८७वाँ सूक्त और नवाँ वर्ग समाप्त हुआ ॥</p>
