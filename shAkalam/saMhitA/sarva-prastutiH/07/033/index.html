Vasisṭha’s Sons (1–9); Vasis ̣ ṭha (10–14) ̣
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (1–9), Vasiṣṭha’s sons (10–14)
14 verses: triṣṭubh
This famous hymn, coming at the very end of the Vasiṣṭha Indra cycle, treats the mystical birth of Vasiṣṭha and the accomplishments of Vasiṣṭha and his descen dants, particularly the feat of attracting Indra to the side of King Sudās and ensur ing Indra’s support in the Battle of the Ten Kings, the battle treated at length in VII.18. The Anukramaṇī identifies the poet of verses 1–9 as Vasiṣṭha and the “deity” as Vasiṣṭha’s sons, with the opposite identifications for verses 10–14, but this does not seem the most perspicuous assignment of roles. Rather, it seems that the hymn falls into three parts: 1–6, 7–9, 10–14, starting with a time close to the (semi mythical) present and moving backward to the deep mythical past.
The first six verses celebrate the Vasiṣṭhas’ successful invitation of Indra to their soma sacrifice and Indra’s subsequent aid to Sudās and the Tr̥tsus in the Ten Kings battle. Indra himself appears to be the speaker in verses 1 and 4. The first two verses depict one of the themes running through this set of Indra hymns: competing sacri
fices. Here, Indra seems actually to rise from his seat at another sacrifice to go to the Vasiṣṭhas in verse 1, with his journey described in verse 2. Verses 3–6 treat his aid to Sudās in the Ten Kings battle, with all credit given to the Vasiṣṭhas’ poetic skill for bringing this aid (vss. 3–5), and Indra himself declaring this in verse 4.
The next section begins with a trio of riddles based on the number three (vs. 7), with the last pāda of that verse asserting that it is exactly this knowledge that the Vasiṣṭhas control—a nice meta-comment on what Vedic poets were supposed to know. There is no consensus (modern or ancient) on the answers to these three riddles. The three producers of semen may be the three soma-pressings, or heaven (with its rain), soma, and man—and other answers have also been suggested. The three Ārya “creatures” with light in front could be the three ritual fires, or the fire, the sun, and dawn—and, again, there are other possible solutions. As for the three “heats,” these could again be the ritual fires, or the sun, the fire, and the gharma924 VII.33
drink, or some other triad. It is perhaps pleasing that the Vasiṣṭhas’ esoteric knowl edge has remained safe with them for over three millennia! This skill of theirs at decoding secrets and putting them in proper verbal form is celebrated further in verse 8 and the first half of verse 9.
The second half of verse 9 provides the transition to the last section, concern ing the birth of Vasiṣṭha. What the Vasiṣṭhas are weaving (a motif recurring almost verbatim in vs. 12) is not entirely clear, but we are inclined to think it concerns the institution and performance of the sacrifice. It is clear why they are approaching the Apsarases (the heavenly “nymphs” of Vedic and later Indian culture): one of the Apsarases’ number, Urvaśī, is their mother (see vss. 11–12), with Mitra and Varuṇa as their father (see vss. 11, 13), in the first of their forefather Vasiṣṭha’s births. Both births are referred to in verse 10, both that from Mitra and Varuṇa and that when Agastya presented him to the clan. To say that the details of the births are murky is an understatement, and we will not attempt here to interpret all the mysteries in these verses. The last verse (14) is traditionally taken as Agastya’s words, introduc
ing Vasiṣṭha to his adoptive clan, the Tr̥tsus, and outlining Vasiṣṭha’s ritual role. The address to “you thrusters forth” (pratr̥daḥ) is most likely a pun on their name.">

Vasisṭha’s Sons (1–9); Vasis ̣ ṭha (10–14) ̣<br>
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (1–9), Vasiṣṭha’s sons (10–14)<br>
14 verses: triṣṭubh<br>
This famous hymn, coming at the very end of the Vasiṣṭha Indra cycle, treats the  mystical birth of Vasiṣṭha and the accomplishments of Vasiṣṭha and his descen dants, particularly the feat of attracting Indra to the side of King Sudās and ensur ing Indra’s support in the Battle of the Ten Kings, the battle treated at length  in VII.18. The Anukramaṇī identifies the poet of verses 1–9 as Vasiṣṭha and the  “deity” as Vasiṣṭha’s sons, with the opposite identifications for verses 10–14, but this  does not seem the most perspicuous assignment of roles. Rather, it seems that the  hymn falls into three parts: 1–6, 7–9, 10–14, starting with a time close to the (semi mythical) present and moving backward to the deep mythical past.<br>
The first six verses celebrate the Vasiṣṭhas’ successful invitation of Indra to their  soma sacrifice and Indra’s subsequent aid to Sudās and the Tr̥tsus in the Ten Kings  battle. Indra himself appears to be the speaker in verses 1 and 4. The first two verses  depict one of the themes running through this set of Indra hymns: competing sacri<br>
fices. Here, Indra seems actually to rise from his seat at another sacrifice to go to the  Vasiṣṭhas in verse 1, with his journey described in verse 2. Verses 3–6 treat his aid to  Sudās in the Ten Kings battle, with all credit given to the Vasiṣṭhas’ poetic skill for  bringing this aid (vss. 3–5), and Indra himself declaring this in verse 4.<br>
The next section begins with a trio of riddles based on the number three (vs.  7), with the last pāda of that verse asserting that it is exactly this knowledge that  the Vasiṣṭhas control—a nice meta-comment on what Vedic poets were supposed  to know. There is no consensus (modern or ancient) on the answers to these three  riddles. The three producers of semen may be the three soma-pressings, or heaven  (with its rain), soma, and man—and other answers have also been suggested. The  three Ārya “creatures” with light in front could be the three ritual fires, or the fire,  the sun, and dawn—and, again, there are other possible solutions. As for the three  “heats,” these could again be the ritual fires, or the sun, the fire, and the gharma924 VII.33<br>
drink, or some other triad. It is perhaps pleasing that the Vasiṣṭhas’ esoteric knowl edge has remained safe with them for over three millennia! This skill of theirs at  decoding secrets and putting them in proper verbal form is celebrated further in  verse 8 and the first half of verse 9.<br>
The second half of verse 9 provides the transition to the last section, concern ing the birth of Vasiṣṭha. What the Vasiṣṭhas are weaving (a motif recurring almost  verbatim in vs. 12) is not entirely clear, but we are inclined to think it concerns the  institution and performance of the sacrifice. It is clear why they are approaching the  Apsarases (the heavenly “nymphs” of Vedic and later Indian culture): one of the  Apsarases’ number, Urvaśī, is their mother (see vss. 11–12), with Mitra and Varuṇa  as their father (see vss. 11, 13), in the first of their forefather Vasiṣṭha’s births. Both  births are referred to in verse 10, both that from Mitra and Varuṇa and that when  Agastya presented him to the clan. To say that the details of the births are murky  is an understatement, and we will not attempt here to interpret all the mysteries in  these verses. The last verse (14) is traditionally taken as Agastya’s words, introduc<br>
ing Vasiṣṭha to his adoptive clan, the Tr̥tsus, and outlining Vasiṣṭha’s ritual role.  The address to “you thrusters forth” (pratr̥daḥ) is most likely a pun on their name.</p>

<p>[Indra:] They, bright-faced, with their braids on the right side, quickening  thought—because they exhilarated me,<br>
I, standing up from the ritual grass, speak about the superior<br>
men: “They cannot be helped by me from a distance—the Vasiṣṭhas.”</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>By most accounts this vs. is spoken by Indra, who is the referent of the 1st ps. enclitics mā and me in pādas a and d and the subj. of 1st ps. voce in c.</p>
<p>As noted already ad VII.18.21, Geldner has a peculiar interpr. of the verbal lexeme (abhí) prá √mad as ‘go on a pilgrimage’, for which there is no support that I can see.</p>
<p>Oldenberg also rejects this interpr. I follow Oldenberg’s view that Indra is present at a competing sacrifice &ndash; a constant preoccupation of the Indra hymns of VII &ndash; and recalling the Vasiṣṭhas’ ritual service to him, he gets up to the leave the sacrifice where he is present to go to theirs. Pāda d is the embedded self-quotation of Indra, providing the reason for his departure for the Vasiṣṭhas.</p>
<p>The descriptors of the Vasiṣṭhas śvityáñcaḥ … dakṣiṇatáskapardāḥ are found almost identically in VII.83.8 śvityáñcaḥ … kapardínaḥ, where they modify the Tṛtsus, Sudās’s fighting force in the Ten Kings Battle, in a hymn much concerned with that battle. Vasiṣṭha was at least an adoptive member of the Tṛtsu clan. See Geldner’s n. 1a and esp. vss. 5, 6, and 15 in this hymn.</p>
<p>Despite the position of the generally sentential, Wackernagel’s Law particle hí far to the right in b, the verb complex abhí hí pramandúḥ must have domain over the entire hemistich, with mā in 2nd pos. in pāda a serving as its object. As often, when a preverb stays with its verb at the end of a clause rather than moving to the front of its clause, hí is inserted, between preverb and verb (or here preverb1 and preverb 2 verb).</p>

<p>“Disgracing (Pāśadyumna), they brought from afar the fierce <strong>Indra</strong>, when drinking the ladle of <strong>Soma</strong> <strong>athis</strong> sacrifice, to (receive) the libation (of <strong>Sudāsa</strong>); Indra hastened from the effused Soma of Pāśadumna, theson of Vāyata, to the <strong>Vasiṣṭhas</strong>.”</p>

<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>They brought: A legend is related. The sons of <strong>Vasiṣṭha</strong> had undertaken <strong>asoma</strong> sacrifice to Indra on behalf of Sudāsa. They found that he was present at a similar solemnity instrumental tuted bythe <strong>rājā</strong> Pāśadyumna, the son of Vāyata, on which they abused the rājā, broke off his sacrifice, and bytheir <strong>mantras</strong>, compelled Indra to come to that of their patrons</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>From a distance they led Indra here with pressed (soma)—across a lake’s  worth (of soma), on beyond the powerful drink.<br>
Over the pressed soma of Pāśadyumna Vāyata he preferred the Vasiṣṭhas.</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>In this vs. the perspective and location shifts from Indra, at the competing sacrifice announcing his intention to go to the Vasiṣṭhas, to the Vasiṣṭhas at their place of sacrifice “leading” Indra to them. The vss. are linked by dūrā́t ‘from a 38 distance’ (1d, 2a), in 1d referring to the distant location of the Vasiṣṭha from Indra’s point of view, in 2a the distant location of Indra from that of the Vasiṣṭhas.</p>
<p>With Oldenberg, I consider Pāśadyumna Vāyata the hapless sacrificer whom Indra deserted in favor of the Vasiṣṭhas. But I do not follow Oldenberg in thinking that b describes an intermediate place on Indra’s journey from PV to the Vasiṣṭhas.</p>

<p>With this vs. we pass to the Ten Kings Battle and the Vasiṣṭhas’ crucial efforts in securing Indra’s aid for Sudās. The emphatic repeated opening of the first three pādas evén nú kam highlights the critical incidents. The two sequences evéd and nú kam are both found fairly frequently elsewhere, but never elsewhere together, so it’s difficult to judge the force of their combination.</p>

<p>Of your rogenitors: pitṛṇām, in the genitive, plural used honorifically, implying father, i.e.<strong>Vasiṣṭha</strong>; I have set in motion: akṣam avyayam = rathasya akṣam avyayāmi, cālayāmi, I cause to move theaxle of the car, ascribing the words to Vasiṣṭha, as announcing his intention to return to his hermitage</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>[Indra:] Gladly, you superior men, by reason of your fathers’ sacred  formulation, I have engirded the axle: you will certainly not be<br>
harmed,<br>
since with a lofty cry in Śakvarī [=martial] (meter) you established<br>
impetuous force in Indra, o Vasiṣṭhas.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>Geldner appears to be right that this vs. is also Indra’s speech. He picks up the bráhmaṇā vaḥ from 3d in pāda a and also addresses them as ‘superior men’ (voc. naraḥ), just as he spoke about the superior men (acc. nṝ́n) in 1c.</p>
<p>Geldner takes pitṝṇā́m with both júṣṭī and bráhmaṇā; I doubt the first, as does Oldenberg</p>
<p>Since I think Indra is addressing the Vasiṣṭhas at the time of the battle, not a younger generation of Vasiṣṭhas long after the battle, his “by reason of your fathers’ sacred formulation” (bráhmaṇā vo pitṝṇā́m) must refer to the formulation they inherited from their own poetic forebears and are putting to use in enlisting Indra’s help.</p>
<p>The action Indra performs in response to the Vasiṣṭhas’ employment of the bráhman- is not altogether clear. (Oldenberg, after some speculation, concludes “&lsquo;ich komme hier nicht zur Klarheit.”) The bare phrasing ákṣam avyayam must mean literally “I enveloped the/an axle,” but whose axle it is and whether the enveloping is a help or a hindrance aren’t recoverable from context. However, as Oldenberg points out, III.53.19 may provide some guidance. That vs. is addressed to an axle (voc. ákṣa) in a series of vss. (17-20) mean to avert possible disasters that might afflict a team of oxen and the vehicle they are pulling. In vs. 19 the axle is urged abhí vyayasva khadirásya sā́ram “Engird yourself in the hardwood of the Acacia tree,” before being told to be and stay firm (vīḷáyasva). The first instruction to the axle contains the verb (abhí) √vyā ‘envelop, engird’, which I take as referring to fixing the ends of the axle firmly in the wheel hubs till the ends are literally surrounded with / enveloped in the wood of the wheel hub. If the same type of action is referred to here, Indra is performing a positive action, presumably securing the axle of the Vasiṣṭhas or their allies in position, to protect them and their chariot from harm, as Indra promises with ná kílā riṣātha.</p>
<p>As Geldner points out (n. 4c), śákvarī- is the name of a meter with martial associations. As he also points out, this fairly rare meter is found in the first three vss.</p>
<p>of X.133, a hymn to Indra attributed to Sudās Paijavana, that is, the royal hero of the Ten Kings Battle, though there is no particular ref. to that battle in X.133. Since śákvarīṣu is plural here, it would be better tr. “in Sakvarī (verses)” than “in Śakvarī (meter),” as in the published translation 39</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>

Since, when ye sang aloud the Sakvari verses, Vasisthas! ye invigorated Indra.</p>

<p>“Suffering from thirst, soliciting (rain), supported (by the Tṛtsus) in the war with the ten <strong>rājās</strong>, (theVasiṣṭhas) made <strong>Indra</strong> radiant as the sun; Indra heard (the praises) of <strong>Vasiṣṭha</strong> glorifying him, and bestowed aspacious region on the Tṛtsus.”</p>

<p>Like thirsty ones looking toward heaven (for rain), in distress they  looked toward (Indra) when they were surrounded in the Battle of the  Ten Kings.<br>
Indra hearkened to Vasiṣṭha as he was praising; he made the broad space  broad for the Tr̥tsus.</p>

<p>People of the Tṛtsus: Tṛtsus are the same as the Bharatas. <strong>Saṃvaraṇa</strong>, the son of <strong>Ṛkṣa</strong>, thefourth in descent from <strong>Bharata</strong>, the son of <strong>Duṣyanta</strong>, was driven from his kingdom by the <strong>Pāñcālas</strong>, andobliged to take refuge with his tribe among the thickets on the <strong>Sindhu</strong> until Vasiṣṭha came to them andconsented to be the <strong>rājā</strong>&rsquo;s purohit, when they recovered their territory</p>

<p>They were cut off short, like goads for driving cattle—the puny Bharatas. When Vasiṣṭha came to be the leader, right after that did the clans of the  Tr̥tsus spread out.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>It is a curious, but perhaps coincidental, fact that the sole occurrence of daṇḍá- in the RV is found in the same hymn with the only occurrence of the vṛddhi deriv. maitrāvaruṇá- (vs. 11), given that the daṇḍa- ‘staff’ is the emblem of office associated with the Maitrāvaruṇa priest in śrauta ritual. See Minkowski, Priesthood in Ancient India, pp. 141-54 and passim. The conjunction in our hymn was pointed out to me by Elizabeth Tucker.</p>
<p>The addition of the pejorative and sometimes diminutive suffix -ka- on a word already meaning ‘small’ &ndash; arbha-ká- &ndash; is a nice slangy touch.</p>
<p>In c the ca appears to be subordinating (so also Klein, DGRV I.242-43), though because ábhavat is pāda-initial, its accent need not be due to subordination.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>
<p>Like sticks and staves wherewith they drive the cattle, Stripped bare, the Bharatas were found defenceless:<br>
Vasistha then became their chief and leader: then widely. were the Trtsus&rsquo; clans extended.</p>

<p>Wie beschnittene Stecken zum Ochsentreiben waren die schwachen Bharata´s abgeschnitten. Als Vasistha ihr Führer ward, da breiteten sich die Clane der Tritsu´s aus.</p>

<p>Wie Stäbe, mit denen man Ochsen treibt, waren zerspalten die schwachen Bharater ; da ward VasisChtha ihr Führer, und nun dehnten sich aus der Tritsu Stämme.</p>

<p>The hidden thousand-branched world: niṇyamsahasravalśam abhisañcaranti, they completely go over the hidden, tirohitam, or durjñānam, ignorant,<strong>sahasra</strong> valśam, thousand-branched, that is, saṃsāram, the revolving world of various living beings, or thesuccession of many births; the allusion is to the repeated births of <strong>Vasiṣṭha</strong>, who is the first of the <strong>Prajāpatis</strong>,or mind-born sons of <strong>Brahmā</strong>, who is the son of <strong>Urvaśī</strong>; hṛdayasya praketaiḥ prajñānaiḥ, internalconvictions or knowledge; this may imply the detachment of Vasiṣṭha or his sons from the world. The <strong>apsaras</strong> sitdown: yamena tatam paridhim vayanto <strong>apsarasa</strong> upasedur vasiṣṭhāḥ: te vasiṣṭhāḥ, those vasiṣṭhas or thatvasiṣṭha;</p>
<p>Yamena = sarvaniyantrā, by the restrainer or regulator of all; kāraṇātmanā, identical with cause,that is, by acts, as the causes of vital condition; the garb paridhim, vastram, spread, tatam, by him, is herevolution of life and death; janmādipravāhāḥ, weavin, vayantaḥ; connecting this with <strong>apsarasaḥ</strong>, the myphs,or, the nymph Urvaśī, who sat down or approached in the capacity of a mother, jananitvena, wearing thatvesture which he was destined by former nets to wear</p>

<p>Agasya bore you:agastyo yat tvā viśā ājabhāra = yadā purvavasthānāt tvām ājahāra, when Agastya took you from theformer condition; mitrāvaruṇau āvām janayisyāva, we two Mitra and Varuṇa, will beget; or, āvābhyāmayam jāyeta iti samakalpatām, the two divinities determined this Vasiṣṭha shall be begotten by us</p>

<p>When Mitra and Varuṇa saw you as light compacting itself from out of  the lightning—<br>
that was (one) birth of yours, Vasiṣṭha, and (there was) one when<br>
Agastya brought you here for the clan.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>In III.51.4 I take sám √hā as ‘compact oneself together’, that is, ‘concentrate one’s essence’, and that seems the image here, of the embryonic Vasiṣṭha taking shape from concentrated lightning. Geldner (n. 10a) suggests rather that it refers to semen suddenly poured out. I do not see this, and his suggested parallel in X.95.10 seems irrelevant, esp. since the lightning there is Urvaśī.</p>
<p>Oldenberg’s argument that vs. 10 depicts one birth and the following vss. another depends in part on taking the two utá’s of 10c and 11a as marking the two births.</p>
<p>This would be more convincing if the first utá were not in the middle of the pāda.</p>
<p>This position seems better accounted for by assuming that 10c refers to both births, with utá conjoining tát te jánma and ékam, as Geldner takes it (“das war deine (eine) Geburt and eine …”). So also Klein (DGRV I.368). The double yád in b and d support this interpr., with each yád introducing one of the births. I follow this general interpr.</p>
<p>The yád in b is very deep in its clause, with both subj. and obj. preceding it, if pādas ab form a single clause as in the standard tr. (incl. Geldner and the published translation). It 40 would, however, be possible to take pāda a as the main clause on which b is dependent: “light was compacting out of lightning when M+V looked upon you.” This would solve the problem, but the unusual position of yád could also be attributed to an attempt to make b and d parallel, each recounting one of the births and opening with the putative father (or fathers) followed by yád, with a preterital verb and the obj. tvā (the latter in different orders): b mitrā́váruṇā yád ápaśyatāṃ tvā and d agástyo yát tvā viśá ājabhā́ra. In this scenario, pāda a, which is a single NP, would have been fronted around the core clause.</p>
<p>With Oldenberg (fld. by Geldner), I read dat. viśé contra Pp. viśáḥ. The clan in question is supposed to be the Tṛtsus.</p>

<details open><summary><h7>10-13 ...{Loading}...</h7></summary>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>Oldenberg discusses Vasiṣṭha’s two births and suggests that they are presented in reverse chronological order. The birth depicted in vs. 10 is the second birth, while 11-13 treat the first. In the first birth Mitra and Varuṇa emit semen at a Sattra, which falls into a pot and ultimately gives rise to the seer Agastya. But a drop of this semen is taken into a lotus, somehow comes to the Apsaras Urvaśī, who somehow conceives and gives birth to Vasiṣṭha “from mind.” In the second birth the wondrously conceived divine being of the 1st birth is received into a human Gotra.</p>
<p>Oldenberg is uncertain about the details; I am even more uncertain.</p>

<p>“Verily, <strong>Vasiṣṭha</strong> you are the son of <strong>Mitra</strong> and <strong>Varuṇa</strong>, born, <strong>Brahmā</strong>, of the will of <strong>Urvaśī</strong>, after theseminal effusion; all the gods have sustained you, (endowed) with celestial and Vedic vigour in the lake.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>Born ofthe will of Urvaśī: Urvaśī, on seeing the birth of the Ṛṣi, said to herself, let this be my son; Endowed withcelestial and vedic vigour: brahmaṇā daivyena; adding an epithet: yuktam, joined with; devasambandhinavedarāśināhambhuva yuktam;</p>
<p><strong>Puṣkara</strong> = <strong>kumbha</strong>, pitcher used at sacrifice, or the vasatīvara, the pool ofwater prepared for the same. Vasiṣṭha was born when the vessel, puṣkara, was over-filled and some contentsfell upon the earth. <strong>Agastya</strong> was born of the contents in the vessel; the overflowing fluid being collected together,Vasiṣṭha remained in the lake, tato apsu gṛhyamāṇāsu vasiṣṭhāḥ puṣkare <strong>sthitaḥ</strong>; Puṣkara is also thename of a lake in <strong>Ajmer</strong>; <strong>Padma Purāṇa</strong> cites it as the hermitage of Agastya (<strong>Sṛṣṭi</strong> <strong>khaṇḍa</strong>)</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>And you are the descendant of Mitra and Varuṇa, o Vasiṣṭha, born  from Urvaśī, from her mind, you formulator.<br>
A drop (of semen?) spurted forth: with a heavenly formulation all the  gods took you in a lotus.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The pub. tr. reads “born from her mind,” but given the uncertainties of this birth story, the mind need not be Urvaśī’s, but someone else’s, or even pure mind. So it might be better rendered as “born from mind.” On the semen (if that’s what the drop is) and the lotus, see disc. ad vss. 10-13.</p>
<p>If the underlying narrative really does involve transporting spilled semen in a leaf and long-distance conception therefrom, it anticipates the MBh narrative in which the king Vasu ejaculates while hunting, catches the semen in a leaf, and tries to send it home to his wife Girikā by enlisting a bird, though the bird and the semen meet with a disaster over water that leads to the semen impregnating a fish (MBh I.57.35ff.).</p>
<p>I take drapsáṃ skannám as a nominal clause, rather than taking cd as a single clause with drapsáṃ skannám coreferential with tvā.</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>Oldenberg discusses Vasiṣṭha’s two births and suggests that they are presented in reverse chronological order. The birth depicted in vs. 10 is the second birth, while 11-13 treat the first. In the first birth Mitra and Varuṇa emit semen at a Sattra, which falls into a pot and ultimately gives rise to the seer Agastya. But a drop of this semen is taken into a lotus, somehow comes to the Apsaras Urvaśī, who somehow conceives and gives birth to Vasiṣṭha “from mind.” In the second birth the wondrously conceived divine being of the 1st birth is received into a human Gotra.</p>
<p>Oldenberg is uncertain about the details; I am even more uncertain.</p>

<p>He, foreknowing of both in his insight, possessing a thousand gifts and  one gift (more),<br>
intending to weave the covering stretched by Yama, was born from the  Apsaras—Vasiṣṭha.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>As Geldner points out (n. 12a), praketá- is otherwise only a noun, and so it is best to go against the Pp’s reading praketáḥ in favor of the loc. praketé. (Geldner also entertains the possibility of reading *sapraketáḥ.) The “both” are presumably both births; so Geldner</p>
<p>The weaving in pāda c is repeated almost verbatim from 9c, but with the single Vasiṣṭha, not the pl. Vasiṣṭhas as subject. As noted in the published introduction, I assume that this refers to the production of the sacrifice. See comm. ad vs. 14 below.</p>
<p>The hapax sádāna- is not entirely clear. Geldner suggests that it stands for</p>
<p>*sádādāna- by haplology and tr. “der … immerdar Geschenke hat.” He does not
render the utá vā, implicitly taking sahásradānaḥ … sádānaḥ as appositive adjectives.</p>
<p>Klein (DGRV II.169) follows Geldner’s interpr. of sádānaḥ without mentioning the possible haplology and states that the conjoined terms in the phrase sahásradana utá vā sádānaḥ “come close to being synonymous.” His tr. “having a thousand gifts or having constant gifts” both illustrates this suggestion and shows how flat-footed such a phrase would be. Oldenberg discusses without coming to a conclusion, though he does reject the haplology explan., which goes back to Ludwig. My own interpr. takes the text as given and interprets the second adj. as additive “and one gift (more),” with sádāna- ‘with (a) gift’ standing for ‘with one gift’. If the utá vā should be read as disjunctive ‘or’ (as I admit it should), perhaps this is instead a version of the Archilochus fox-and-hedgehog dichotomy (“the fox knows many things, but the 41 hedgehog one big one”) &ndash; hence “having a thousand gifts &ndash; or one (big) gift.” This in fact is now my preferred tr. What the gifts refer to I have no idea.</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>Oldenberg discusses Vasiṣṭha’s two births and suggests that they are presented in reverse chronological order. The birth depicted in vs. 10 is the second birth, while 11-13 treat the first. In the first birth Mitra and Varuṇa emit semen at a Sattra, which falls into a pot and ultimately gives rise to the seer Agastya. But a drop of this semen is taken into a lotus, somehow comes to the Apsaras Urvaśī, who somehow conceives and gives birth to Vasiṣṭha “from mind.” In the second birth the wondrously conceived divine being of the 1st birth is received into a human Gotra.</p>
<p>Oldenberg is uncertain about the details; I am even more uncertain.</p>

</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>This vs. is the basis of Oldenberg’s (and others’) reconstruction of the 1st birth of Vasiṣṭha (see comm. add vss. 10-13), with Mitra and Varuṇa at a Sattra emitting semen into a pot, which then gave rise to both Agastya and Vasiṣṭha. Unfortunately the details of this vs. are far from clear, though pāda b does (fairly) straightforwardly depict a dual entity pouring semen into a pot.</p>
<p>The gravest problems are in pāda a. The opening satré ha is interpr. by Sāyaṇa, fld. by Geldner, as standing for sattré ‘at a Sattra’. The single -t- versus double -tt- before</p>
<p>-r- is of course not a problem [Max Müller’s ed. in fact prints sattré], but it is the
case that, though the word sat(t)rá- and its ritual complex are well attested already in Saṃhitā prose, the word is not found elsewhere in the RV. (However, the ritual almost surely already existed; there seems a clear reference to it in vs. 9 of the Indra hymn III.31, where the Aṅgirases “sit a sitting” [sádanam √sad, though with the words not in the same VP] to open the Vala cave. See comm. ad loc.) However, Grassmann suggests reading *satréhá instead, to be analyzed as the adv. satrā́‘entirely’ and ihá ‘here’; the only change required would be accenting the second word. Oldenberg sits on the fence, but seems weakly to favor the Sattra interpr., as do I, since it at least provides richer semantics and a ritual context for the actions. Moreover the particle ha would exactly match the same particle in the same location in pāda c.</p>
<p>The next problem is jātaú. If it is a dual ppl. (rather than a loc. sg. to the putative stem jātí-, which, however, is not found in the RV), it can of course modify the dual subjects of the verb siṣicathuḥ, and it is also quite possible that that dual subject is Mitra and Varuṇa, as Oldenberg and Geldner interpr. it. The problem is thus not syntactic but semantic. In what way would M+V be “born” at a Sattra? Geldner elides the problem by (as far as I can see) folding it into an anodyne phrase with iṣitā́, rendered as “erregt geworden,” where I assume the ‘geworden’ is a bleached, auxiliary-like version of jātaú. Sāyaṇa glosses it as dīkṣitau, and this might nicely reflect the middle Vedic configuration of the dīkṣā of a soma sacrificer as tantamount to a second birth.</p>
<p>No forms of the (secondary) root √dīkṣ are found in the RV; however, both dīkṣā́- and dīkṣitá- are attested in the AV, with the former fairly common. I therefore am inclined to follow Sāyaṇa’s interpr. &ndash; or what I assume Sāyaṇa’s interpr. rests on &ndash; that jātaú refers to the conceptual rebirth of a consecrated sacrificer. This rebirth would be somewhat comparable to the two births of Vasiṣṭha himself. This interpr. of jātaú would be more clearly expressed than in the published translation by rendering it “(re)born [=consecrated] at a (ritual) Session.” Pāda c appears to describe the creation of Agastya (see comm. above ad vss.</p>
<p>10-13). Māna is the name of Agastya’s father and family or indeed of Agastya himself. See Mayrhofer PN s.v. for reff.</p>
<p>Kümmel (99, 570) has a very diff. interpr. of the vs. In the first hemistich he takes kumbhé as a dual, modified by the dual ppl. in pāda a and subject of the dual verb in b: “Beim Somaopfer geboren, angetrieben durch Verehrungen haben die beiden Krüge den gemeinsamen Samen ergossen” (99). This is grammatically impossible, 42 because kumbhá- is masc., as the two occurrences of the acc. pl. kumbhā́n show, and so its dual should be *kumbhā́(u). In c he takes mā́naḥ as ‘house’: “Mitten daraus ist ein Haus hervorgegangen” (99=570). He does not comment on the mythological content of the vs., but though mā́na- ‘building, house’ is at least marginally attested in the RV (clearest in VII.88.5), the creation of a house from semen would be such an outlandish feat that the creation of a seer seems positively plausible.</p>
<p>In b the pf. siṣicatuḥ has a retroflexed root init., as we would expect. But the other two forms of the pf. in the RV (sisicuḥ II.24.4 and sisice III.32.15) do not. I have no explanation for the discrepancy.</p>

<p>Oldenberg discusses Vasiṣṭha’s two births and suggests that they are presented in reverse chronological order. The birth depicted in vs. 10 is the second birth, while 11-13 treat the first. In the first birth Mitra and Varuṇa emit semen at a Sattra, which falls into a pot and ultimately gives rise to the seer Agastya. But a drop of this semen is taken into a lotus, somehow comes to the Apsaras Urvaśī, who somehow conceives and gives birth to Vasiṣṭha “from mind.” In the second birth the wondrously conceived divine being of the 1st birth is received into a human Gotra.</p>
<p>Oldenberg is uncertain about the details; I am even more uncertain.</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>As Geldner (n. 14) points out, this vs. seems to pick up 10d, describing the second “birth” of Vasiṣṭha, when Agastya presents him to the clan, and it seems to consist of Agastya’s direct speech. As Oldenberg points out, the first hemistich seems to identify the three priests of śrauta ritual, though not by title: the Hotar, supporter of the ukthá-; the Udgātar, supporter of the sā́man-; and the Adhvaryu, supporter of the pressing stone, i.e., the one who performs the physical actions. Assuming this is the case makes it reasonably likely that the weaving of “the covering stretched by Yama” (9c, 12c) does indeed refer to the production of the sacrifice. Vasiṣṭha is thus presented as responsible for the whole of the sacrifice, not just a portion of it.</p>

<p>भावार्थभाषाः -  या मंत्रात वाचकलुप्तोपमालंकार आहे. जो विद्यार्थी संपूर्ण वेदविद, कुशिक्षा व अविद्या नष्ट करणारा व विद्वानांची चांगल्या प्रकारे सेवा करून, विद्या प्राप्त करून पुन्हा अध्यापन करतो, जिज्ञासू लोक विद्याप्राप्तीसाठी त्याच्याजवळ याचना करतात. ॥ १४ ॥</p>
