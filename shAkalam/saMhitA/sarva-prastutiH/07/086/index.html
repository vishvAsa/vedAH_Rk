Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn and the following three hymns (VII.87–89) are justly famous because they have an unusually intimate tone and because the poet Vasiṣṭha as a literary creation of the poem emerges as a distinct personality. Jamison (2007: 91–118) offers a detailed study of the hymns in this group and of the creation of the poet’s personality. Like the other hymns in this small collection, this poem centers on just two figures, the poet—Vasiṣṭha according to tradition—and the god Varuṇa, and Vasiṣṭha speaks personally, even confessionally with Varuṇa. Apparently Vasiṣṭha has been suffering from some kind of affliction, which, he has been told, is the pun ishment of King Varuṇa for an offense. He begs Varuṇa to accept his offerings and repentance, to forgive his transgressions, which he says were not intentional (vs. 6), and to restore him to prosperity and health.
The relationship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa constantly shifts as the hymn unfolds. The literary strategy of the poem most clearly appears in its use of pro nouns and other markers of person, as Jamison (2007: 96–100) shows in her analysis. Use of the 3rd person distances the speaker and the object, while addressing another as “you” is a token of closeness and presence to one another. The poet deploys these pronouns first to distance Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, then to bring them close, and finally to separate them once again. So in verse 1 Vasiṣṭha is absent because there is no reference to the speaker, and Varuṇa is distanced by the 3rd singular pronoun asya. His absence is mitigated only by fact that unaccented asya should be anaphoric and therefore might point to the previous presence of the god. Otherwise, the relation
ship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa is completely broken. In verse 2 Vasiṣṭha is present (1st sg. in each of the four lines), and Varuṇa remains distanced. In verse 3 Vasiṣṭha is present once again (1st sg.) and Varuṇa is partly present: he is addressed in the vocative but he is also mentioned in the 3rd person. In verse 4 both Vasiṣṭha (1st sg.) and Varuṇa (2nd sg.) are present. Then there begins a retreat from their full presence to one another. In verse 5 Vasiṣṭha is less present (the 1st pl. generalizes rather than personalizes the speaker) and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address and 2nd sg. imperative). This verse reverses 3, in which Vasiṣṭha was fully present but Varuṇa partly present. In verse 6 Vasiṣṭha is distanced (note especially svá “one’s own,” not “my own”), and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address). Again this verse reverses 2, in which Vasiṣṭha was present and Varuṇa was distanced. In verse 7 Vasiṣṭha is present (1st sg.), but Varuṇa is distanced (3rd sg.). This partially reverses 1 insofar as Vasiṣṭha was absent there but is present here. Varuṇa remains distanced in both verses 1 and 7. The last verse (8), is a concluding, extra-hymnic verse, a coda that stands outside the main structure of the hymn.
This analysis also shows the omphalos structure of the hymn. Verse 1 corresponds to 7, verse 2 to 6, verse 3 to 5, and verse 4 is the center. It is the thematic heart of the hymn because it is in this verse that the poet and the god are both present and pres ent to one another. It also signifies the determination of Vasiṣṭha, who anticipates the resolution of his conflict with Varuṇa. Varuṇa will—perhaps even in the sense of “must”—proclaim what Vasiṣṭha has done, and Vasiṣṭha promises to make amends to the god to receive the god’s forgiveness. Although the hymn moves away from this encounter between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, the last verse suggests that the problem has been resolved. Varuṇa has returned to the distance, but he and Vasiṣṭha now mutually support one another. Varuṇa has enlightened Vasiṣṭha (vs. 7c), and Vasiṣṭha ritually serves the god to his greater “wealth,” his power and glory (7d).
In verse 2b the meaning of váruṇe “within Varuṇa” may play on the possible ety mological relation of váruṇa and vratá “commandment.” That is, “within Varuṇa” has the sense of “under, or in conformity with, the commandment of Varuṇa.” The poet wants to be no longer at odds with Varuṇa. At the same time the hope for closeness to the god or even for envelopment by the god, which is suggested in the phrase, looks forward to the increasing intimacy of Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa. The state is both parallel to and contrasts with the situation in verse 6c where the elder is “within the misdeed of the younger.”
In verse 4d, we read áva…īyām, from ava &#43; √yā “make recompense,” instead of the transmitted but metrically faulty áva…iyām.">

Varuṇa<br>
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi<br>
8 verses: triṣṭubh<br>
This hymn and the following three hymns (VII.87–89) are justly famous because  they have an unusually intimate tone and because the poet Vasiṣṭha as a literary  creation of the poem emerges as a distinct personality. Jamison (2007:  91–118)  offers a detailed study of the hymns in this group and of the creation of the poet’s  personality. Like the other hymns in this small collection, this poem centers on just  two figures, the poet—Vasiṣṭha according to tradition—and the god Varuṇa, and  Vasiṣṭha speaks personally, even confessionally with Varuṇa. Apparently Vasiṣṭha  has been suffering from some kind of affliction, which, he has been told, is the pun ishment of King Varuṇa for an offense. He begs Varuṇa to accept his offerings and  repentance, to forgive his transgressions, which he says were not intentional (vs. 6),  and to restore him to prosperity and health.<br>
The relationship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa constantly shifts as the hymn  unfolds. The literary strategy of the poem most clearly appears in its use of pro nouns and other markers of person, as Jamison (2007: 96–100) shows in her analysis.  Use of the 3rd person distances the speaker and the object, while addressing another  as “you” is a token of closeness and presence to one another. The poet deploys these  pronouns first to distance Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, then to bring them close, and finally  to separate them once again. So in verse 1 Vasiṣṭha is absent because there is no  reference to the speaker, and Varuṇa is distanced by the 3rd singular pronoun asya.  His absence is mitigated only by fact that unaccented asya should be anaphoric and  therefore might point to the previous presence of the god. Otherwise, the relation<br>
ship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa is completely broken. In verse 2 Vasiṣṭha is present  (1st sg. in each of the four lines), and Varuṇa remains distanced. In verse 3 Vasiṣṭha  is present once again (1st sg.) and Varuṇa is partly present: he is addressed in the  vocative but he is also mentioned in the 3rd person. In verse 4 both Vasiṣṭha (1st sg.)  and Varuṇa (2nd sg.) are present. Then there begins a retreat from their full presence  to one another. In verse 5 Vasiṣṭha is less present (the 1st pl. generalizes rather than  personalizes the speaker) and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address and  2nd sg. imperative). This verse reverses 3, in which Vasiṣṭha was fully present but  Varuṇa partly present. In verse 6 Vasiṣṭha is distanced (note especially svá “one’s  own,” not “my own”), and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address). Again this verse reverses 2, in which Vasiṣṭha was present and Varuṇa was distanced. In  verse 7 Vasiṣṭha is present (1st sg.), but Varuṇa is distanced (3rd sg.). This partially  reverses 1 insofar as Vasiṣṭha was absent there but is present here. Varuṇa remains  distanced in both verses 1 and 7. The last verse (8), is a concluding, extra-hymnic  verse, a coda that stands outside the main structure of the hymn.<br>
This analysis also shows the omphalos structure of the hymn. Verse 1 corresponds  to 7, verse 2 to 6, verse 3 to 5, and verse 4 is the center. It is the thematic heart of the  hymn because it is in this verse that the poet and the god are both present and pres ent to one another. It also signifies the determination of Vasiṣṭha, who anticipates  the resolution of his conflict with Varuṇa. Varuṇa will—perhaps even in the sense of  “must”—proclaim what Vasiṣṭha has done, and Vasiṣṭha promises to make amends  to the god to receive the god’s forgiveness. Although the hymn moves away from this  encounter between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, the last verse suggests that the problem has  been resolved. Varuṇa has returned to the distance, but he and Vasiṣṭha now mutually  support one another. Varuṇa has enlightened Vasiṣṭha (vs. 7c), and Vasiṣṭha ritually  serves the god to his greater “wealth,” his power and glory (7d).<br>
In verse 2b the meaning of váruṇe “within Varuṇa” may play on the possible ety mological relation of váruṇa and vratá “commandment.” That is, “within Varuṇa”  has the sense of “under, or in conformity with, the commandment of Varuṇa.”  The poet wants to be no longer at odds with Varuṇa. At the same time the hope  for closeness to the god or even for envelopment by the god, which is suggested in  the phrase, looks forward to the increasing intimacy of Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa. The  state is both parallel to and contrasts with the situation in verse 6c where the elder  is “within the misdeed of the younger.”<br>
In verse 4d, we read áva&hellip;īyām, from ava + √yā “make recompense,” instead of  the transmitted but metrically faulty áva&hellip;iyām.</p>

<p>पदार्थान्वयभाषाः -  (वरुण) हे मङ्गलमय परमात्मन् ! वह (किं) क्या (ज्येष्ठं) बड़े (आगः) पाप (आस) हैं, (यत्) जिनके कारण (सखायं) मित्ररूप आप (स्तोतारं) उपासकों को(जिघांससि) हनन करना चाहते हैं, (तत्) उनको (प्र) विशेषरूप से (मे) मेरे प्रति (वोचः) कथन करें। (दूळभ) हे सर्वोपरि अजेय परमात्मन् ! (त्वा) आप (स्वधावः) ऐश्वर्य्यसम्पन्न हैं, इसलिए (अनेनाः) ऐसे पापों से (अव) रक्षा करें, ताकि मैं (नमसा) नम्रतापूर्वक (तुरः) शीघ्र ही (इयां) आपको प्राप्त होऊँ॥४॥</p>
</details>
<details><summary>आर्यमुनि - भावार्थः</summary>
<p>भावार्थभाषाः -  इस मन्त्र में उपासक अपने पापों के मार्जननिमित्त परमात्मा से प्रार्थना करता है कि हे महाराज ! वह मैंने कौन बड़े पाप किये हैं, जिनके कारण मैं आपको प्राप्त नहीं हो सकता अथवा आपकी प्राप्ति में विघ्नकारी है। हे मित्ररूप परमेश्वर ! आप मेरा हनन न करते हुए अपनी कृपा द्वारा उन पापों से मुझे निर्मुक्त करें, ताकि मैं शीघ्र ही आपको प्राप्त होऊँ ॥ तात्पर्य्य यह है कि पुरुष जब तक अपने दुर्गुणों को आप अनुभव नहीं करता, तब तक वह अपना सुधार नहीं कर सकता। मनुष्य का सुधार तभी होता है, जब वह अपने आपको आत्मिक उन्नति में निर्बल पाता है। परमात्मा आज्ञा देते हैं कि जिज्ञासु जनों ! तुम अघमर्षणादि मन्त्रों के पाठ द्वारा अपने आपको पवित्र बनाकर मेरे समीप आओ, तुम्हें आनन्द प्राप्त होगा ॥५॥</p>

(स्वः) अपनी प्रकृति से जो (दक्षः) कर्म किया जाता है, (सः) वही पापप्रवृत्ति में कारण (न) नहीं होता, किन्तु (ध्रुतिः) मन्दकर्मों में जो दृढ़ प्रवृत्ति है, (सा) वह (सुरा) मद के तुल्य होने से (मन्युः) क्रोध, पापप्रवृत्ति का कारण है और (विभीदकः) द्यूतादि व्यसन तथा (अचित्तिः) अज्ञान (अस्ति) है, (ज्यायान्, कनीयसः, उपारे) इस तुच्छ जीव के हृदय में अन्तर्यामी पुरुष भी है, जो शुभकर्मी को शुभकर्मों की ओर उत्साह देता और मन्दकर्मी को मन्दप्रवाह की ओर प्रवाहित करता है, (स्वप्नः, चन, इत्) स्वप्न का किया हुआ कर्म भी (अनृतस्य, प्रयोता) अनृत की ओर ले जानेवाला होता है॥६॥</p>
</details>
<details><summary>आर्यमुनि - भावार्थः</summary>
<p>भावार्थभाषाः -  इस मन्त्र का आशय यह है कि अपने स्वभाव द्वारा किया हुआ कर्म ही पाप की ओर नहीं ले जाता, किन्तु (१) जीव की प्रकृति=स्वभाव, (२) मन्दकर्म, (३) अज्ञान, (४) क्रोध, (५) ईश्वर का नियमन, ये पाँच जीव की सद्गति वा दुर्गति में कारण होते हैं, जैसा कि कौषीतकी उप० में वर्णन किया है कि “एष एव साधु कर्म कारयति, तं यमधो निनीषते” कौ० ३।३।८।=जिसको वह देव अधोगति को प्राप्त कराना चाहता है, उसको नीचे की ओर ले जाता और जिसको उच्च बनाना चाहता है, उसको उन्नति के पथ पर चलाता है। यहाँ यह शङ्का होती है कि ऐसा करने से ईश्वर में वैषम्य तथा नैर्घृण्यरूप दोष आते हैं अर्थात् ईश्वर ही अपनी इच्छा से किसी को नीचा और किसी को ऊँचा बनाता है ? इसका उत्तर यह है कि ईश्वर पूर्वकृत कर्मों द्वारा फलप्रदाता है और उस फल से स्वयंसिद्ध ऊँच-नीचपन आजाता है। जैसे किसी पुरुष को जहाँ नीचकर्म करने का दण्ड मिला, उतने काल जो वह स्वकर्म करने से वञ्चित रहा, इससे वह दूसरों से पीछे रह गया। इस भाव से ईश्वर जीव की उन्नति तथा अवनति का हेतु है, वास्तव में जीव के स्वकृत कर्म ही उसकी उन्नति तथा अवनति में कारण होते हैं। इसी भाव से जीव को कर्म करने में स्वतन्त्र और भोगने में परतन्त्र माना है, कर्मानुसार फल देने से ईश्वर में कोई दोष नहीं आता ॥६॥</p>
