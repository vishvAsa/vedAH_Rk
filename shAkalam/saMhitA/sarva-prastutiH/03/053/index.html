Viśvāmitra Gāthina
24 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 10, 16; anuṣṭubh 12, 20, 22; gāyatrī 13; br̥hatī 18
This sprawling hymn, a supplement to the Indra collection, consists of at least six different sections in five different meters. There is little or no connection among the parts, which were probably originally independent. However, the whole seems intended to glorify the poet Viśvāmitra and his family, the Kuśikas, as well as his patron, King Sudās, and the Bharatas. Moreover, several of the different parts have clear reminiscences of other hymns in the Indra cycle of this maṇḍala, and so the hymn serves as a sort of summary of the themes of this Indra collection.
The beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–6) is the most conventional part, with its invitation to Indra to come to our ritual with gifts and to drink the soma. The most interesting feature is the mention of the pleasures of wife and home (vss. 4–6) and the envoi to Indra in verse 6, urging him to go home after consuming the soma at our sacrifice. (See also I.82.5–6.) This dismissal seems appropriate to the final hymn of the Indra collection and may in part account for this little hymn being appended here. The next section (vss. 7–14) is subtly soldered to the first: the final word of verse 6 is dákṣiṇāvat “accompanied by priestly gifts,” while the first phrase of verse 7 is imé bhojā́ḥ “these benefactors”—the word bhojá is used through out the hymn devoted to the dakṣiṇā (X.106) to refer to the bestowers of the priestly gifts. The whole of this second section concerns the relationship of the poet Viśvāmitra and his family with his patron, King Sudās and his people, the Bharatas, via the mediation of Indra, whose powers the poet can command for the sake of Sudās and his subjects because of his poetic gifts. There are several reminiscences of previous Indra hymns in III. Verse 7, with the patrons com
pared to the Aṅgirases, recalls the extensive treatment of the Aṅgirases in III.31. Verse 9 gives a synopsis of III.33, in which Viśvāmitra stops the rivers flowing so Sudās and his troops can cross; the name Sudās is mentioned in this story only here. Viśvāmitra’s family, the Kuśikas, are found here in verses 9–11; in III.33.5 he calls himself “the son of Kuśika,” and a repeated verse containing the plural of the name serves as a ring-compositional marker for the whole of the Indra cycle of Maṇḍala III (III.30.20 = III.50.4), as discussed in the introduction to the latter hymn. This section ends with a slighting mention of a rival and appar ently non-sacrificing group, whom Indra is urged to subjugate to Sudās and the Bharatas.
The next two verses (15–16) are the most mysterious in the hymn; they both concern a female figure identified as sasarparī́, the formation and etymology of which is unclear and which may either be a proper name or an attributive charac terizing adjective. (Our translation, “the squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī,” is a portmanteau containing both adjectives evoked by the phonology and mor phology of the word and the proper name; we consider it a multiple semi-pun.) The Anukramaṇī assigns these two verses to Vāc [=“speech”] Sasarparī, and some scholars consider that the figure the embodiment of the Kuśikas’ verbal art. In any case she seems to be responsible for the fame of the people she aids.
The next four verses (17–20) appear to have no connection with the rest of the hymn. They are prayers to deflect various possible catastrophes that might befall a team of oxen and the vehicle they pull on a journey, and wish for safe return. This section reads as if it were a continuation of or expansion on the Zauberspruch at the end of III.33 against potential difficulties afflicting a team and its wagon at a ford.
The final four verses (21–24) are very difficult to interpret. They have tradition ally been taken as the expression of the implacable hostility between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha, which is a staple of later texts (e.g., the Mahābhārata). But there is no whiff of this personal hostility in the R̥gveda, in our opinion, and there is certainly no mention of Vasiṣṭha, direct or indirect, in the verses here. There is, however, hostility: verse 21 calls on Indra to help us defeat our enemy, and the next few verses express in colorful images the impotence of the enemy’s actions and weapons. The most puzzling verse is the final one, where the Bharatas, the people">

Indra, etc.<br>
Viśvāmitra Gāthina<br>
24 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 10, 16; anuṣṭubh 12, 20, 22; gāyatrī 13; br̥hatī 18<br>
This sprawling hymn, a supplement to the Indra collection, consists of at least  six different sections in five different meters. There is little or no connection  among the parts, which were probably originally independent. However, the  whole seems intended to glorify the poet Viśvāmitra and his family, the Kuśikas,  as well as his patron, King Sudās, and the Bharatas. Moreover, several of the  different parts have clear reminiscences of other hymns in the Indra cycle of this  maṇḍala, and so the hymn serves as a sort of summary of the themes of this  Indra collection.<br>
The beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–6) is the most conventional part, with its  invitation to Indra to come to our ritual with gifts and to drink the soma. The most  interesting feature is the mention of the pleasures of wife and home (vss. 4–6) and  the envoi to Indra in verse 6, urging him to go home after consuming the soma  at our sacrifice. (See also I.82.5–6.) This dismissal seems appropriate to the final  hymn of the Indra collection and may in part account for this little hymn being  appended here. The next section (vss. 7–14) is subtly soldered to the first:  the final word  of verse 6 is dákṣiṇāvat “accompanied by priestly gifts,” while the first phrase  of verse 7 is imé bhojā́ḥ “these benefactors”—the word bhojá is used through out the hymn devoted to the dakṣiṇā (X.106) to refer to the bestowers of the  priestly gifts. The whole of this second section concerns the relationship of the  poet Viśvāmitra and his family with his patron, King Sudās and his people, the  Bharatas, via the mediation of Indra, whose powers the poet can command for  the sake of Sudās and his subjects because of his poetic gifts. There are several  reminiscences of previous Indra hymns in III. Verse 7, with the patrons com<br>
pared to the Aṅgirases, recalls the extensive treatment of the Aṅgirases in III.31.  Verse 9 gives a synopsis of III.33, in which Viśvāmitra stops the rivers flowing so  Sudās and his troops can cross; the name Sudās is mentioned in this story only  here. Viśvāmitra’s family, the Kuśikas, are found here in verses 9–11; in III.33.5  he calls himself “the son of Kuśika,” and a repeated verse containing the plural  of the name serves as a ring-compositional marker for the whole of the Indra  cycle of Maṇḍala III (III.30.20 = III.50.4), as discussed in the introduction to  the latter hymn. This section ends with a slighting mention of a rival and appar ently non-sacrificing group, whom Indra is urged to subjugate to Sudās and the  Bharatas.<br>
The next two verses (15–16) are the most mysterious in the hymn; they both  concern a female figure identified as sasarparī́, the formation and etymology of  which is unclear and which may either be a proper name or an attributive charac terizing adjective. (Our translation, “the squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī,”  is a portmanteau containing both adjectives evoked by the phonology and mor phology of the word and the proper name; we consider it a multiple semi-pun.)  The Anukramaṇī assigns these two verses to Vāc [=“speech”] Sasarparī, and some  scholars consider that the figure the embodiment of the Kuśikas’ verbal art. In any  case she seems to be responsible for the fame of the people she aids.<br>
The next four verses (17–20) appear to have no connection with the rest of the  hymn. They are prayers to deflect various possible catastrophes that might befall a  team of oxen and the vehicle they pull on a journey, and wish for safe return. This  section reads as if it were a continuation of or expansion on the Zauberspruch at  the end of III.33 against potential difficulties afflicting a team and its wagon at  a ford.<br>
The final four verses (21–24) are very difficult to interpret. They have tradition ally been taken as the expression of the implacable hostility between Viśvāmitra  and Vasiṣṭha, which is a staple of later texts (e.g., the Mahābhārata). But there  is no whiff of this personal hostility in the R̥gveda, in our opinion, and there is  certainly no mention of Vasiṣṭha, direct or indirect, in the verses here. There is,  however, hostility: verse 21 calls on Indra to help us defeat our enemy, and the next  few verses express in colorful images the impotence of the enemy’s actions and  weapons. The most puzzling verse is the final one, where the Bharatas, the people</p>
<p>of Sudās, celebrated in verse 12, appear to be presented in an unflattering light. We  have no explanation for this.</p>

<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>The genitive rator of the gods: <strong>devajāḥ</strong> = the genitive rator of radiances or energies, tejasām janayitā; arrested the watery stream: astabhnāt sindhum arṇavam: he is said to have stoped the current of the confluence of the vipās/ā and <strong>śutudri</strong> rivers; indra with the kuśikas was plural ased: apriyayata kuśikebhir Indra = kuśikagotrotpannair ṛṣibhiḥ <strong>saha</strong>, with the ṛṣis of the <strong>kuśika</strong> lineage, or it might be rendered, plural ased by the Kuśikas</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“Sages and saints overlookers of the leaders (of sacred rites), <strong>Kuśikas</strong>, when the <strong>Soma</strong> is expresssed with stones at the sacrifice, then exhilarating (the gods) with praises, sing the holy strain (aloud) like (screaming) swans, and, together with the gods, drink the sweet juice of the Soma.”</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>Like geese, you make a signaling call with the pressing stones,<br>
becoming exhilarated on hymns at the ceremony when (the soma) is  pressed. You inspired seers who have the sight of men, along with the gods<br>
drink the somian honey, you Kuśikas.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The published translation does not recognize or render the idiom ví √pā, found generally in the middle, for which see also comm. ad VII.22.3. As is indicated there, in later Vedic and already in late RV, the idiom is specialized for the separation of surā from another liquid in the Sautrāmaṇī ritual, but earlier can refer more generally to the extraction (“drinking out”) of a liquid from another source, e.g., by the pressing stones in IV.16.3 and VII.22.3. What the idiom is doing here is less clear to me. Geldner (n. 10d / Witzel Gotō) thinks this is a reference to the (much later) notion that haṃsas can separate liquids and so it belongs with the Sautrāmaṇī passages &ndash; the haṃsa being found in pāda a, though only in a simile unrelated to drinking. I think this unlikely. It may simply be that the pressing stones are involved: the Kuśikas may be “drinking out” the soma by means of the pressing stones found in pāda a (ádribhiḥ).</p>
<p>However, it is also possible that the ví represents the cross-species aspect of the drinking party: the mortal Kuśikas are urged to drink along with the gods, but the gathering may be segregated. So perhaps a tr. “drink apart, along with the gods”; such a notion seems to underlie Renou’s “Buvez séparément avec les dieux.” It would contrast with a true symposium expressed by sám √pā also in the middle (see IV.35.7, 9) and in fact might allude to that idiom, given the well-known polarization of ví and sám. Another possibility is Sāyaṇa’s parasparavyatihāreṇa ‘by mutual interchange, alternately’. I am weakly inclined towards the pressing stone interpretation, though also somewhat drawn to the cross-species one. And I would also point out the resonance of the preverb ví with viśvā́mitraḥ (9c) and viprāḥ (10c).</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“Approach, <strong>Kuśikas</strong>, the steed of <strong>Sudās</strong>; animate (him), and let him loose to (win) riches (for the <strong>raja</strong>); for the king (of the gods) has slain <strong>Vṛtra</strong> in the East, in the West, in the North, therefore let (Sudās) worship him in the best (regions) of the earth.”</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>Come forth, Kuśikas; make yourselves known. Release the horse of  Sudās, to (gain) wealth.<br>
The king will smash the obstacle to the east, to the west, to the north.  Then he will sacrifice on the best part of the earth.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>This vs. is supposed to depict the Aśvamedha of King Sudās, and the releasing of the horse in b and the smiting of obstacles in all directions in c, followed by a sacrifice in d, certainly support this interpr.</p>
<p>cetáyadhvam is variously rendered, but most generally as ‘pay attention’ vel sim. I instead take this middle full-grade -áya-formation as a reflexive transitive “make yourselves known” based on the ‘make perceive’ sense of cetáya-. Renou’s alternative “faites vous remarquer” is closest to mine.</p>
<p>As Watkins points out (Dragon, p. 208), although this form of the intens. of √han has a singular object (somewhat unusually), it is “serially plural,” in that the vṛtrám is located in one cardinal direction after another; see also Schaeffer 204-5.</p>

<p>Come forward, Kusikas, and be attentive; let loose Sudas&rsquo;s horse to win him riches.<br>
East, west, and north, let the King slay the foeman, then at earth&rsquo;s choicest place perform his worship.</p>

<p>“I have made <strong>Indra</strong> glorified by these two, heaven and earth, and this prayer of <strong>Viśvāmitra</strong> protects the race of <strong>Bharata</strong>.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>Made Indra glorified: indram atuṣṭavam&ndash; the verb is the third preterite of the casual, I have caused to be praised; it may mean: I praise Indra, abiding between heaven and earth, i.e. in the firmament</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>I who have praised both these two world-halves here and Indra— Viśvāmitra’s sacred formulation here guards the Bharata people.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The first hemistich, couched in the 1st ps., consists only of a rel. clause, which breaks off. The “I” is clearly Viśvāmitra, whose name opens the hemistich and whose protective bráhman- is mentioned there &ndash; making it very likely that pādas ab constitute this bráhman-, though it’s not quite clear what is protective about this truncated utterance.</p>
<p>The plupf. átuṣṭavam should not exist, at least in my opinion, since the two forms of the indicative pf. tuṣṭuvúḥ (VIII.6.12, 18) also appear to have preterital value. However, the contexts in VIII.6 do not guarantee that value &ndash; it is possible that they are presential “they praise” (see comm. ad VIII.6.12). The existence of a pf.</p>
<p>subj. tuṣṭávat at VIII.98.16 also suggests that the indicative pf. is, or originally was, presential. The only other pf. forms in the RV, the act. part. tuṣṭuváṃs- (3x) and mid.</p>
<p>part. tuṣṭuvāná- (1x) are generally tr. as preterital, but again context does not dictate this rendering.</p>

<p>Usurer: ā <strong>bhara</strong> pramagandasya <strong>vedas</strong>: maganda = kusidin, or usurer, one who says to himself, the money that goes from me will come back doubled, and pra = a patronymic; low branches of the community: naicāśākham, that which belongs to a low (<strong>nīca</strong>) branch, or class (<strong>śākha</strong>); the posterity born of <strong>Śūdras</strong> and the like</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>As indicated in the published introduction, the subject of these two vss. is the mysterious feminine sasarparī́-, which has been interpr. as differently as “Kriegstrompete” (BR, fld. by Grassmann), “Sangesgeweise” of the Viśvāmitras (Geldner), and Vāc (Anukramaṇī, Sāyaṇa.). The interpr. of these vss. has been further complicated by the later tradition that sees them as concerning the supposed rivalry between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha, for which I see no evidence at all in the RV.</p>
<p>Although I do not think all the puzzles are ultimately solvable, some clues can get us some distance. First, sasarparī́- is a vṛkī-type fem., and as Debrunner points out (AiG II.2.369), the major use of this inflectional type is for female beings (human and animal). This lends some credence to the opinion that the sasarparī́- is a cow of some sort (e.g., Renou “La (vache) Sasarparī”). That vs. 14 concerns the ritually worthless cows of the Kīkaṭas would also support a contrast with an eminently worthy cow found among us. Second, these two vss. sound rather like a dānastuti (see jamádagnidatta- in 15b and yā́m me palastijamadagnáyo dadúḥ in 16d), and since the next part of the hymn goes off in a completely different direction, this could serve as a hymn-capping dānastuti for what precedes. Cf. I.126.2, a dānastuti hymn, where, after Kakṣīvant is given cows, he stretches the king&rsquo;s unaging fame to heaven: diví śrávo ‘járam ā́tatāna, highly reminiscent of our 2nd hemistich … tatāna, śrávo devéṣv amṛ́tam ajuryám.</p>
<p>Even if this sketch of the function of the vss. and of Sasarparī is accepted (a big if), it remains to analyze the word. I consider it a portmanteau pun. On the one hand it is a kind of anagram for the intensive of √sṛp ‘creep’, found in the RV only as the hapax adj. sarīsṛpá- (X.162.3), which I tr. ‘squirming’. On the other hand, it is also phonologically reminiscent of sabar-dúgha-, -duh- ‘sap-yielding’, of milk cows</p>
<p>&ndash; two occurrences of which are found in nearby III.55 (vss. 12, 16) qualifying Night
and Dawn, one of whom bellows (mimāya as here) in vs. 13. (Acdg. to Griffith, Grassmann associates Sasarparī with Sabardughā, though this is not registered in the dictionary.) Just as the Sasarparī brings fame in 16, so does a sabardúh- in VI.48.12-13 “milk out immortal fame” (śrávò ‘mṛtyu dhúkṣata). Another possible association is sarpís- ‘melted butter’, adduced by Mayrhofer as a possible relative of sasarparī́- (EWA s.v. sarpís-). My tr. “squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī” reflects my sense that all of these words have contributed to the designation sasarparī́- and these contributions are positive: sabardúgha- and sarpís- reflect the fecundity and richness associated with juice and fat, sarīsṛpa- the uncontainable vitality of a squirming young animal.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is highly speculative and does not rest on properly chaste etymological principles, but it is difficult to see what could with regard to this maddening but phonologically delectable word.</p>
<p>The next question to ask is why Sasarparī “banishes neglect” (ámatim bā́dhamānā). Again this phrase supports the notion that the referent of sasarparī́- is a cow. In I.53.4 and X.42.10 ámati- is overcome by cows; the word is paired with hunger (kṣúdh-) in VIII.66.14, X.42.10, and X.43.3. Hunger and neglect can be combatted with cows and their nourishing products, and one of the combatants is Sasarparī.</p>

<p>The squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī swiftly brought fame to  them among the communities of the five peoples,<br>
having taken on new life (like Dawn, though) in her winglessness, she  whom the Palastis and Jamadagnis gave me.
᳓</details></p>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>Besides the continuing problem of sasarparī́-, the other difficulty is the hapax pakṣyā̀in c. Grassmann takes it as ‘aus Monatshälften bestehend’ (flg. BR), Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) ‘auf meiner Seite stehend’, Renou as ‘ailée’ or ‘prenant parti (pour moi)’. The published translation</p>
<p>strikes out on its own (though closest to Renou’s first alternative). It involves reading sā́pakṣyā̀against the Pp (but involving no change in the Saṃhitā text), to be divided sā́apakṣyā̀. The latter would be the instr. of a nominal abstract in - i yā- (see AiG II.2.840), a rare but attested type built primarily to -a-stems. Here potentially to apakṣá- ‘wingless’ (cf. AV XI.5.21), hence ‘winglessness’. What might this bizarre confection have to do with the passage? The rather flimsy connection is via the daughter of the Sun (sū́ryasya duhitā́in 15c) and a possible reference to Dawn in 16c: the same phrase návyam ā́yur dádhānā is used of Dawn in VII.80.2). (Like) the former, Sasarparī has stretched the Kuśikas’ fame to the gods; (like) the latter, she has brought fame to all the five peoples. These feats might be expected to require special forms of transport, such as wings, if the agent is not a supernatural traveler like Dawn or the Sun’s Daughter. But Sasarparī is a cow, hence wingless.</p>
<p>I realize how fragile &ndash; and potentially ludicrous &ndash; this suggestion is, however, and it might be better to play it safe with something like ‘on my side’.</p>

This lends some credence to the opinion that the sasarparī́- is a cow of some sort (e.g., Renou “La (vache) Sasarparī”). That vs. 14 concerns the ritually worthless cows of the Kīkaṭas would also support a contrast with an eminently worthy cow found among us. Second, these two vss. sound rather like a dānastuti (see jamádagnidatta- in 15b and yā́m me palastijamadagnáyo dadúḥ in 16d), and since the next part of the hymn goes off in a completely different direction, this could serve as a hymn-capping dānastuti for what precedes. Cf. I.126.2, a dānastuti hymn, where, after Kakṣīvant is given cows, he stretches the king&rsquo;s unaging fame to heaven: diví śrávo ‘járam ā́tatāna, highly reminiscent of our 2nd hemistich … tatāna, śrávo devéṣv amṛ́tam ajuryám.</p>
<p>Even if this sketch of the function of the vss. and of Sasarparī is accepted (a big if), it remains to analyze the word. I consider it a portmanteau pun. On the one hand it is a kind of anagram for the intensive of √sṛp ‘creep’, found in the RV only as the hapax adj. sarīsṛpá- (X.162.3), which I tr. ‘squirming’. On the other hand, it is also phonologically reminiscent of sabar-dúgha-, -duh- ‘sap-yielding’, of milk cows</p>
<p>&ndash; two occurrences of which are found in nearby III.55 (vss. 12, 16) qualifying Night

Just as the Sasarparī brings fame in 16, so does a sabardúh- in VI.48.12-13 “milk out immortal fame” (śrávò ‘mṛtyu dhúkṣata). Another possible association is sarpís- ‘melted butter’, adduced by Mayrhofer as a possible relative of sasarparī́- (EWA s.v. sarpís-). My tr. “squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī” reflects my sense that all of these words have contributed to the designation sasarparī́- and these contributions are positive: sabardúgha- and sarpís- reflect the fecundity and richness associated with juice and fat, sarīsṛpa- the uncontainable vitality of a squirming young animal.</p>

In I.53.4 and X.42.10 ámati- is overcome by cows; the word is paired with hunger (kṣúdh-) in VIII.66.14, X.42.10, and X.43.3. Hunger and neglect can be combatted with cows and their nourishing products, and one of the combatants is Sasarparī.</p>

<p>“May the horse be steady, the axle be strong, the pole be not defective, the yoke not be rotten; may <strong>Indra</strong> preserve the two yoke-pins from decay; car with uninjured felloes, be ready for us.”</p>

<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>The horses: gāvau gaccheta iti gāvau aśvau: <strong>gāvā</strong> implies those who go, or, in this plural ce, horses; car be ready for us: <strong>Viśvāmitra</strong> being about to depart from the sacrifice of <strong>Sudās</strong>, invokes good fortune for his conveyance</p>

<p>Let the two oxen be steadfast, the axle firm; let the chariot-pole not be  torn off, nor the yoke be broken off.<br>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>As noted in the published introduction, this verse and the rest of this little section are reminiscent of the final vs. of III.33.13, against disaster on a journey, specifically there a river crossing.</p>
<p>The hapax pātalyè is entirely unclear, besides being a dual referring to some part of the chariot.</p>
<p>On the thematic medial stem dáda- in the sense ‘hold, keep safe’, see Gotō (1st Class, 171-72, flg. Wackernagel).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>Khayar and śiśu: khadirasya sāram is the text;</p>
<p><strong>Khadira</strong> = mimosa catechu of which the bolt of the axle is made; while the <strong>śiṃśapa</strong>, dalbergia <strong>sisu</strong> furnishes wood for the floor; these are still timber-trees in common use</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>Engird yourself in the hardwood of the acacia tree; place strength in the  śiṃśapā(-wood) in its recoil.<br>
O Axle, you who are firm and were made firm, stay firm. Don’t make us  leave off from this journey.
᳓</details></p>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>On abhí vyayasva see comm. ad VII.33.4. I assume ‘engird’ refers to the ends of the axle being embedded in the wheel hub.</p>
<p>The loc. spandané is generally taken as a third type of wood (besides khadiráand śiṃśápā-), but while the other two words are standard designations of trees, spandaná- is ordinarily not, but rather refers to a type of motion &ndash; jerking or kicking.</p>
<p>I take it to refer here to the elasticity or flexibility of Dalbergia sissoo (śiṃsapā-), a quality it has (at least acdg. to the internet).</p>

<p>On the problematic ā́vasā́ā́(Saṃhitā) / ā́ava’saí ā́(Pp.), see detailed disc.</p>
<p>by Scarlatta (576-77), who lays out the various phonological and morphological possibilities. As he points out, the reading of Holland van Nooten, ā́ávasā ā́, with accent on the first a (possible on the basis of the Saṃhitā text) and deaccentuation of the final ā of the noun (contra both Saṃhitā and Pp), makes no sense (and does not conform to the transmitted text). The nominal form between the two ā́’s is by most accounts a root noun cmpd of √sā + áva. The question is what the case form is. I follow Whitney (§971a) and Oldenberg in reading -ās, contra the Pp., interpreting it (with Whitney and Oldenberg) as an irregular abl. sg. to this root noun cmpd. (expect *avasás) in infinitival usage. The parallelism in the hemistich supports this interpr., but see the other possibilities offered by Scarlatta.</p>

<p>The ellipse: as the tree is cut down by the axe, so may the enemy be cut down; as one cuts off without difficulty the flower of the śimbal, so may he be destroyed; as the <strong>ukhā</strong> (cauldron) when struck (prahata), and thence leaking (yeṣantī, sravantī), scatters foam or breath from its mouth, so (<strong>dveṣṭa</strong> madīya, <strong>mantra</strong> sāmarthyena prahataḥ san, phenam mukhād udgirtu), may that hater, struck by the power of my prayer vomit foam fromhis mouth</p>

<p>With Oldenberg, I reject the interpr. of cid in abc as a simile particle (contra Sāyaṇa and Geldner); in all three cases the cid can be interpreted in its usual ‘even, even though, just’ sense. However, I differ from Oldenberg on the purport of the vs. He thinks it describes concrete events, possibly as a “Beschreibung von Zauberhandlungen,” while I think it contains two figurative descriptions of the impotence of the enemy &ndash; in this I am closer to Geldner’s notion of similes than to Oldenberg I also find myself in the odd position of being in general agreement with Griffith’s interpr. (based on Ludwig’s).</p>
<p>Each hemistich describes an action involving great effort and drama that produces trivial and insubstantial results. In ab an ax is thoroughly heated, but this formidable weapon only cuts off the blossom of a silk cotton tree. (That silk cotton tree flowers are a vivid red might remind the audience of the real blood that might have been shed by a blazing hot ax.) In cd a pot, also heated, is boiling (yéṣantī), indeed has boiled over (práyastā), but all it produces is foam.</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“Men, (the might) of the destroyer is not known toyou; regarding him as a mere animal, they lead him away desirous (silently to complete his devotions); the wise condescend not to turn the foolish into ridicule, they do not lead the ass before the horse.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>Legend: <strong>Viśvāmitra</strong> was seized and bound by the followers of <strong>Vasiṣṭha</strong>, when observing a vow of silence. These were the reflections of the sage on the occasion: disparaging the rivalry of Vasiṣṭha with himself, as if between an ass and a horse: sāyakasya = of an arrow;here explained, to destroy, avasānakāriṇaḥ; lodham nayanti = they lead the sage;</p>
<p>Lodha = from lubdham, desirous that his penance might not be frustrated, <strong>tapasaḥ</strong> kṣayo mā bhūd iti, lobhena tuṣṇīm sthitam ṛṣim paśum manyamāna, thinking the ṛṣi silent through his desire, to be an animal, i.e., stupid; another interpretation in <strong>Nirukta</strong>:lubdham ṛṣim nayanti paśum manyamānaḥ, they take away the desiring ṛṣi, thinking him an animal; na avājinam vājinā hāsayanti: <strong>vājina</strong> = from vac, speed, with ina affix; interpreted as srvajña, all knowing; the contrary avajina = <strong>mūrkha</strong>, a fool</p>

᳓</details></p>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>In my opinion, at least the first half of this vs. continues the sentiment of vs. 22: the enemy is powerless, despite bluff and bluster. In pāda a older translations supply an unidentified subject (“he”) for cikite, but the medial perfect of √cit is always pass.-intrans. and with Kümmel (176) I take the verb as an impersonal passive with an oblique subj. in the genitive; cf. I.51.7 táva vájraś cikite with the subject in the more normal nom. The point here is that the opponent’s missile (sā́yaka-) is so inconsequential as not to attract or deserve notice.</p>
<p>In b the first problem is the hapax lodhá-, which is universally taken as a red animal of some sort, a horse (Geldner, Renou), fox (Grassmann), or goat (Oldenberg, tentatively EWA). My quite different tr. ‘clod’ assumes (again, very tentatively) an association with a loose set of words for lump, clod, etc.: loṭṭha (Pkt., etc. =Vedic loṣṭá-, perhaps by hypersanskritization) (Turner 11157), *lottha / *lodda / *loddha (Tu. 11137), *luṭṭa (Tu 11077). The point would then be that “they” (whoever they are) lead (to sacrifice?) a lump of earth or the like, thinking that it’s an actual (sacrificial?) beast.</p>
<p>This situation reminds us of the chariot race of Mudgala and Mudgalānī (X.102) in which a block of wood is yoked with a bull, and the oddly assorted pair still wins the race (X.102.8-9). It might also remind us of X.28.9 in which an earth clod (logá-, not too distant phonologically) splits a stone. The other morphological fact of note in this pāda is that páśu is neut. and initially accented (versus the ubiquitous masc. paśú-).</p>
<p>This may be a deep archaism, matching Lat. pecu, Goth. faihu (cf. AiG II.1.20, II.2.474), or it may be a nonce attempt to de-animatize the word in this peculiar context.</p>
<p>Like vs. 22 and 23a, 23b describes an undesirable situation exactly contrary to what was aimed at: having mistaken a lump for a sacrificial animal, the actors will surely not get the results they wanted &ndash; although X.102.8-9 and X.28.9 may point to success in unlikely circumstances. But the second hemistich depicts situations in which, though a mistake was possible, it was not made: they don’t set a bad horse (ávājin-) to race with a good one; they don’t put a donkey before the horses. The question is whether the subjects of the three 3rd pl. verbs (nayanti b, hāsayanti c, nayanti again d) are the same, or are the deluded weaklings of ab being contrasted with more clear-headed and successful actors in cd? Common sense suggests the latter, but the morphologically identical sequence of verbs with no overt subject or change of subject the former (as Oldenberg points out). I cannot make up my mind, esp.</p>
<p>because the following vs. muddies the waters even further.</p>
<p>Given the interpretational difficulties, the grammatical identity of áśvān is a minor problem. In the published translation I take it as acc. pl. áśvān, but the Pp. interprets it as abl. áśvāt, with the final -n in sandhi before the nasal of nayanti. Either is possible (“lead before the horses” / “lead before the horse”), and given the uncertainty of meaning, there is no obvious way to choose. The abl. is supposed to be construed with puráḥ, but in fact ABL. + puráḥ is not a robust construction.</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>As noted in the published introduction, these vss. are traditionally taken as depicting the rivalry between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha, but I see no sign of this here; certainly Vasiṣṭha is not mentioned. The verbal link is supposed to be VII.104.16 adhamás padīṣṭa “let him fall lowest,” a curse uttered in a Vasiṣṭha hymn that echoes our 21c ádharaḥ sás padīṣṭa. But in neither case is the opponent named, and there is no reason to assume that Vasiṣṭha directs this at Viśvāmitra or vice versa.</p>
<p>The first vs. of this sequence (21) is quite straightforward; vs. 22 is more complex, but I feel fairly confident in its interpr. But vss. 23-24 are very difficult, and my interpr. is correspondingly quite provisional.</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“These sons of <strong>Bharata</strong>, <strong>Indra</strong>, understand severance (from the <strong>Vasiṣṭhas</strong>), not association (with them); they urge their steeds (against them) as against a constant foe; they bear a stout bow (for their destruction) in battle.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>Sons of Bharata: descendants of <strong>Viśvāmitra</strong> whose enmity to the lineage of <strong>Vasiṣṭha</strong> is here expressed; the enmity reportedly occurred on account of Viśvāmitra&rsquo;s disciple the <strong>Rājā</strong> <strong>sudās</strong>; Anukramaṇikā states that Vasiṣṭhas hear not the inimical imprecations: <strong>antya</strong> abhiśaparthas ta vasiṣṭadevaṣiṇyaḥ na <strong>vasiṣṭhaḥ</strong> śṛṇvanti;</p>
<p>Niruktam: sa vasiṣṭhadveṣī ṛk-aham ca kapiṣṭhalo <strong>vasi</strong>.ṣhaḥ atas <strong>tana</strong> nirbravīmi, this and the previous verse are inimical to the Vasiṣṭhas and he is of the race of Vasiṣṭha, of the <strong>Kapiṣṭhala</strong> branch</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>Are these the sons of Bharata, Indra? They take note of the non-meal,  not the meal.<br>
They spur the alien horse, not their own. At the contest they lead<br>
around the one whose prize is (just) a bowstring.
᳓</details></p>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>The good sense / bad sense problem continues, or returns, here. The sons of Bharata are ceremonially presented to us, with the here-and-now deictic imé. And we know from vs. 12 that the Bharata people (bhā́rata- jána-) are our people. But here they (or the subjects of the three 3rd pl. verbs: cikituḥ b, hinvánti c, pári ṇayanti d) seem to make the same bad choices that were visible in vss. 22-23, esp. 23b. The continuation of the 3rd pl. verbs invites us to make the Bharatas subjects also in vs. 22.</p>
<p>Is this a jokey anti-dānastuti? Are the “bad choices” I just mentioned meant to show that even if they do stupid things, they will still beat the incompetents depicted in vs. 22? Or that bad choices can still sometimes unaccountably lead to good? I am baffled.</p>
<p>The mealtime prapitvá- is well attested in the RV, but apapitvá- is found only here. Both Geldner and Renou take the words in some kind of figurative sense (e.g., Renou apapitvá- ‘la retraite’, prapitvá- ‘l’élan-en-avant’), but since the -pitvá- compounds are otherwise only used of meals and the times of day associated with them, it seems best to maintain that sense here; so Witzel Gotō ‘die Nachessenzeit’, ‘die Voressenzeit’. In its contrast with pra here, I take apa as meaning ‘leaving the meal, post-prandial’ and therefore ‘non-meal’. My interpr. is influenced by my sense that the lesser choice is the one being made in each case in this vs. In c the standard tr. take ná as a simile marker: “they incite their own horse like an alien one.” But given the paired negative clauses in 23cd and the undoubted negative (or at least undoubted by the standard tr.) in the immediately preceding pāda (24b), where the ná takes the same position as in c, the pattern seems to impose another negative here. Under either interpr. the action is not a very smart one: spurring your own horse like an alien one should presumably mean that you don’t spur it at all.</p>
<p>The accentuation of jyā̀- in the bahuvrīhi jyā̀-vāja-, against simplex jyā́-, is attributed to the shift to initial accent in some other bahuvrīhis: AiG II.1.293 with Nachtr. 81. The standard tr. avoid the problem of the sense of this cmpd by attributing to -vāja- a sense it doesn’t otherwise have: Geldner (Witzel Gotō; cf. Grassmann) Schnelligkeit, Renou la force. But vā́ja- means ‘prize’ and bahuvrīhis with it as 2nd member ‘having X as prize’. I here assume that winning only a bowstring (minus the bow) would not be a glorious outcome.</p>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>As noted in the published introduction, these vss. are traditionally taken as depicting the rivalry between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha, but I see no sign of this here; certainly Vasiṣṭha is not mentioned. The verbal link is supposed to be VII.104.16 adhamás padīṣṭa “let him fall lowest,” a curse uttered in a Vasiṣṭha hymn that echoes our 21c ádharaḥ sás padīṣṭa. But in neither case is the opponent named, and there is no reason to assume that Vasiṣṭha directs this at Viśvāmitra or vice versa.</p>
<p>The first vs. of this sequence (21) is quite straightforward; vs. 22 is more complex, but I feel fairly confident in its interpr. But vss. 23-24 are very difficult, and my interpr. is correspondingly quite provisional.</p>
