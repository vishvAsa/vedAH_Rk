Soma Pavamāna
Pavitra Āṅgirasa
5 verses: jagatī
A well-known hymn, whose manifold difficulties are also well known. It in many ways resembles the famous Vena hymn, X.123, which also involves a mystical iden tification between Soma and the sun. The double meanings and enigmas are, as often, fostered by the suppression of overt reference. Crucial verbs lack expressed subjects, and unidentified asya “of him/it” substitutes for expressed possession (see 2b, 2c, 3c, 4a). The word sóma does not appear in the hymn at all, nor do his com mon epithets. The hymn has elicited many different and contradictory interpreta tions, to which we add our own.
Attributed to the same poet as IX.73, this hymn shares with that earlier one the mystical metaphor of the filter (pavítra), which is also the name of the poet. Indeed, the words “outstretched” and “filter,” construed with each other in the last verse of IX.73 (vs. 9), open this hymn, and the two verses (73.9 and 83.1) both con
cern the qualities required to attain the filter and what it represents. In this hymn the necessary quality is being cooked, rather than raw; it is somewhat startling to encounter this whiff of Claude Lévi-Strauss very much avant la lettre. In this con text “cooked” must refer in the first instance to the ritual preparation of soma. Although this preparation does not involve literal cooking, via application of heat, it clearly turns the raw material extracted from the natural plant into a cultural product, both through physical manipulation and through verbal accompaniment.
But the filter metaphor has a cosmic dimension, as is especially clear in verse 2, where it is compared to the sun with its rays spread across the sky like the tracks of the soma across the filter. The “cooking” of verse 1 provides a neat transition to the “hot one” of verse 2, heat being an obvious characteristic of the sun.
Verse 3 and the first half of verse 4 are quite enigmatic—not surprisingly, given their position in the middle of the hymn. Both the “dappled one” and the “ox” can refer both to the Sun and to Soma, each of whom is also associated with dawn, and the first half of the verse thus continues the Sun/Soma identification of verse 2. The second half of verse 3 appears to contain one of those paradoxes beloved of R̥gvedic bards. In our (very tentative) interpretation, the forefathers are the ancestral poet-sacrificers or their divine prototypes. They both “set” the embryo of Soma/Sun, that is, engendered it, and they were themselves made into poets by the magic power or artifice (māyā́) of the same Soma/Sun. In this way the Soma/ Sun is both progenitor of the forefathers in their ritual role and, as they fulfill their ritual role, their child. The identity of the Gandharva in verse 4 is not entirely clear, but on the basis of parallels, especially in the Vena hymn mentioned above, it seems likely that it is again a double reference to Soma and the Sun, each guarding his track (or perhaps the track of the other), thus taking up the theme of the track found in verse 2.
With the second half of verse 4 we return to a much clearer ritual context and to the filter with which we began. The filter traps the impurities of the soma as the liquid passes over it, and the priests attain (a reprise of the verb found twice in vs. 1) the prepared soma. The final verse (5) returns to the 2nd-person address to the ritual Soma, last found in the first half of verse 1. But the Soma thus addressed has achieved a much-elevated status: he is proclaimed a king, outfitted with cosmic garments and traveling a cosmic course, with the filter, the focus of the hymn, as his chariot. The very last words of the hymn attribute to him “lofty fame.”
The omphalos structure of the hymn is quite pronounced. The outermost verses (1ab, 5) are couched in the 2nd person and have a clear ritual content, with an inner ring (vss. 1cd/2ab, 4cd) serving as transition between the ritual context and the mystical identifications. There are a number of formal responsions that mark these rings, besides the 2nd versus 3rd person of verses 1 and 5: pavítram (1a, 2a) / pavítra(-ratha) (5c); páry eṣi (1b) / pári yāsi (5b); āśata (1d, 4d); padá- (2a, 4a). Enclosed within these rings are the mysterious and shifting identifications that make the hymn both aggravating and mesmerizing.">

Soma Pavamāna<br>
Pavitra Āṅgirasa<br>
5 verses: jagatī<br>
A well-known hymn, whose manifold difficulties are also well known. It in many  ways resembles the famous Vena hymn, X.123, which also involves a mystical iden tification between Soma and the sun. The double meanings and enigmas are, as  often, fostered by the suppression of overt reference. Crucial verbs lack expressed  subjects, and unidentified asya “of him/it” substitutes for expressed possession (see  2b, 2c, 3c, 4a). The word sóma does not appear in the hymn at all, nor do his com mon epithets. The hymn has elicited many different and contradictory interpreta tions, to which we add our own.<br>
Attributed to the same poet as IX.73, this hymn shares with that earlier one  the mystical metaphor of the filter (pavítra), which is also the name of the poet.  Indeed, the words “outstretched” and “filter,” construed with each other in the last  verse of IX.73 (vs. 9), open this hymn, and the two verses (73.9 and 83.1) both con<br>
cern the qualities required to attain the filter and what it represents. In this hymn  the necessary quality is being cooked, rather than raw; it is somewhat startling to  encounter this whiff of Claude Lévi-Strauss very much avant la lettre. In this con text “cooked” must refer in the first instance to the ritual preparation of soma.  Although this preparation does not involve literal cooking, via application of heat,  it clearly turns the raw material extracted from the natural plant into a cultural  product, both through physical manipulation and through verbal accompaniment.<br>
But the filter metaphor has a cosmic dimension, as is especially clear in verse  2, where it is compared to the sun with its rays spread across the sky like the  tracks of the soma across the filter. The “cooking” of verse 1 provides a neat  transition to the “hot one” of verse 2, heat being an obvious characteristic of  the sun.<br>
Verse 3 and the first half of verse 4 are quite enigmatic—not surprisingly, given  their position in the middle of the hymn. Both the “dappled one” and the “ox” can  refer both to the Sun and to Soma, each of whom is also associated with dawn,  and the first half of the verse thus continues the Sun/Soma identification of verse  2. The second half of verse 3 appears to contain one of those paradoxes beloved  of R̥gvedic bards. In our (very tentative) interpretation, the forefathers are the  ancestral poet-sacrificers or their divine prototypes. They both “set” the embryo  of Soma/Sun, that is, engendered it, and they were themselves made into poets by  the magic power or artifice (māyā́) of the same Soma/Sun. In this way the Soma/ Sun is both progenitor of the forefathers in their ritual role and, as they fulfill their  ritual role, their child. The identity of the Gandharva in verse 4 is not entirely clear,  but on the basis of parallels, especially in the Vena hymn mentioned above, it seems  likely that it is again a double reference to Soma and the Sun, each guarding his track (or perhaps the track of the other), thus taking up the theme of the track  found in verse 2.<br>
With the second half of verse 4 we return to a much clearer ritual context  and to the filter with which we began. The filter traps the impurities of the soma  as the liquid passes over it, and the priests attain (a reprise of the verb found  twice in vs. 1) the prepared soma. The final verse (5) returns to the 2nd-person  address to the ritual Soma, last found in the first half of verse 1. But the Soma  thus addressed has achieved a much-elevated status:  he is proclaimed a king,  outfitted with cosmic garments and traveling a cosmic course, with the filter, the  focus of the hymn, as his chariot. The very last words of the hymn attribute to  him “lofty fame.”<br>
The omphalos structure of the hymn is quite pronounced. The outermost verses  (1ab, 5)  are couched in the 2nd person and have a clear ritual content, with an  inner ring (vss. 1cd/2ab, 4cd) serving as transition between the ritual context and  the mystical identifications. There are a number of formal responsions that mark  these rings, besides the 2nd versus 3rd person of verses 1 and 5: pavítram (1a, 2a)  / pavítra(-ratha) (5c); páry eṣi (1b) / pári yāsi (5b); āśata (1d, 4d); padá- (2a, 4a).  Enclosed within these rings are the mysterious and shifting identifications that  make the hymn both aggravating and mesmerizing.</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“Lord or prayer, your filter is stretched out; you who are the sovereign, enter its members from all sides; the raw (liquid) whose mass is not heated attains not this (filter); it is the boiled (liquids) bearing (the sacrifice) which attain it.”</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>The filter is outstretched for you, o lord of the sacred formulation.  Advancing, you circle around its limbs on all sides.<br>
A raw one, with unheated body, does not attain it [=filter]; only the<br>
cooked ones, driving along, have attained it entirely.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>As indicated in the published introduction. and above, ad IX.73.9, this vs. is very like the last vs. of IX.73, a hymn also focused on the filter, both physical and mystical.</p>
<p>The identity of the ‘limbs’ (gā́trāṇi) in b is not entirely clear. I take it as referring to the metaphorical limbs of the filter, though the visual picture thus conjured up is imperfect, unless the fleece filter comes not only from the back but from the legs of the sheep. I do not think it is the limbs of the soma-drinkers, with Renou</p>
<p>I take tád in c to be the filter, again both physical and mystical. As I say in the published introduction, “raw” versus “cooked” in this hemistich refers to the transformation effected on the soma plant by its ritual preparation, even though “cooking” is not technically involved. The pl. in d is presumably the soma drops or drinks, as opposed to the mass sg. in c referring to the as-yet-unprepared plant.</p>

<p>Further identification of soma and the sun. For pṛ́śni- and ukṣán- used of the sun, see, e.g., V.47.3; for the sun supporting the worlds, see X.170.4 (dedicated to Sūrya) yénemā́viśvā bhúvanāny ā́bhr̥tā “by whom all these worlds are borne.” As indicated in the published introduction, I take the 2nd hemistich as expressing a reciprocal paradox: the forefathers were created as masters of artifice (māyāvín-) by the artifice (māyā́-) of Soma/the sun, but they also engendered him. I take the pf.</p>
<p>mamire as passive, with Grassmann The standard tr. (and incl. HPS, Bṛhaspati und Indra, 78) take the verb as transitive, supplying bhúvanāni from b as obj. (I do have to concede that the pf. is otherwise generally transitive.) But under their reading I don’t understand how the forefathers as possessing their own māyā́(māyāvínaḥ) needed “his māyā́” (asya māyáyā) to accomplish the task.</p>
<p>If there is any difference in meaning between māyāvín- (3x) and the far better attested and more orthodoxly formed māyín- I cannot detect it.</p>

<p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>
<p>“The <strong>gandharva</strong> verily protects this station; the marvellous (<strong>Soma</strong>) preserves the races of the gods; the lord of cattle seizes (our enemy) with a snare, the doers of good attain the drinking of the sweet-juiced (Soma).”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya</strong></p>
<p>The lord of cattle: nidhāpatiḥ (the lord of snares) = nidhipatiḥ (the lord of treasure)</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton</summary>
<p>The Gandharva guards his track just so; the infallible one protects the  races of the gods.<br>
The lord of snares [=filter] grasps the defiler with his snare. Those who  best perform (ritual) action have attained the draught of honey.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>
<p>For my view of the Gandharva as another instantiation of soma/the sun see published introduction. This more or less agrees with Geldner (n. 4a: the sun, acdg. to Sāyaṇa.) and Renou (Soma-Gandharva). I do not see this vs. as referring to the Somaraub as Ober does (II.162).</p>
<p>As indicated in the published introduction, with the 2nd hemistich we return to the world of ritual and to the filter specifically.</p>
<p>nidhā̇́- clearly means ‘snare’; see the other occurrence in X.73.11 nidháyeva baddhā́n “bound as if by a snare.” But the semantic dev. from the presumed source ní √dhā is not clear. That lexeme generally means ‘set down, deposit, keep safe/secure’. Perhaps ‘snare’ develops from this last meaning: a device used to secure an object. On this problem see detailed disc. by Scarlatta (255). It would be nice to connect it with ní √dā ‘bind’, but pesky phonology gets in the way.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Griffith</summary>
<p>Gandharva verily protects his dwellingplace; Wondrous, he guards the generations of the Gods.<br>
Lord of the snare, he takes the foeman with the snare: those who are most devout have gained a share of meath.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Geldner</summary>
<p>Gandharva bewacht dort seinen Platz, der Heimliche schützt der Götter Geschlechter. Er faßt den Schelm mit der Schlinge, der Schlingenmeister. Die größten Meister haben den Trunk des Soma erlangt.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Grassmann</summary>
<p>Gandharva ist es, der des Soma Ort bewacht, und unsichtbar der Götter Stämme hütend schützt, Der Herr des Netzes fängt mit seinem Netz den Feind; die frommsten sind zum Trunk des süssen Safts gelangt.</p>
