> Still blows my mind that Virgil signed his name in the letters at the beginning and ends of the opening of the Aeneid and it was only found about ten years ago??

As an aside, could you name at least  2 vipra-s who encode their names in sUkta-s in the RV: not in the same way as Virgil here but comparably indirectly?

> 1. RV 8.39 by Nabhāka Kaṇva  
> Repetitive ending of the Ṛcaḥ with  “…nabhantām anyake same”
>
> 2. RV 10.21, 24 & 25 by Vimada - Repeated use of “…vi vo made”


These are both good examples. Even if a R^iShi names himself directly, he might still use an encoding for his name. Brief thread with e.g.s:

vishvAmitra (take this with the mitra dominance of v'mitra):

> *mitrAya* pa~ncha yemire janA abhiShTishavase | sa devAn *vishvAn* bibharti ||

Here vishvAmitra like the original Virgil example codes his name in reverse.

vAmadeva gautama: 

> *vAmaM-vAmaM* ta Adure *devo* dadAtv aryamA |  
*vAmam* pUShA *vAmam* bhago *vAmaM devaH* karULatI ||

This is the most dense patch of the word vAma in the whole RV.

hiraNyastUpa A~ngirasa:  

See the 4th e.g., in [this](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/07/16/shabdamegha/) analysis: he overuses the word "hiraNya" signaling his own name (e.g. RV 1.35) and weaves it into the epithets of the god savitR^i who has special connection with golden.
