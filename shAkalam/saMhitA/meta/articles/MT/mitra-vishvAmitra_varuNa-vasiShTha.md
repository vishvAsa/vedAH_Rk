The rivalry between vishvAmitra& vasiShTha is mentioned in later H tradition. However, right in the R^igveda they show a peculiar theological inversion. vishvAmitra +++(RV 3)+++ mentions mitra more often than varuNa & vasiShTha the reverse +++(RV 7)+++. Others mention them roughly equally with varuNa>mitra

This original vasiShTha-vishvAmitra theological distinction did not find much traction in post-invasion India, with varuNa gradually fading away into his primarily watery function& mitra being absorbed into the Iranized saura cult. However, in the Iranic steppe we find greater mitra focality. Such a mitra-focal tradition was the likely precursor of western mithraism.
