      <description>&lt;p&gt;As has been repeatedly emphasized above, the R̥gveda is a poetic text, structured  by intricate meters, driven by rhetorical principles based on this metrical structure, and crafted by skillful poets for a poetically aware audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;prose-is-used&#34;&gt;Prose is used&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, we  have chosen to translate the text into prose, not verse—for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First and perhaps most important, we are not poets, and we would dishonor the highly  trained and highly inventive poets of the R̥gveda by translating their artful creations into bad English verse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moreover, the structures of the English language and  of English verse are entirely different from those of Vedic Sanskrit. Since English  lacks the elaborate morphology of Sanskrit, it is not as possible in English, with out awkwardness or, indeed, loss of sense, to use word order for rhetorical rather  than syntactic purposes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The stress-counting principle that regulates English blank  verse and the end rhyme characteristic of much English poetry are alien to R̥gvedic  poetry.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus the English poetry that resulted from a verse translation would not  replicate in any of its most salient features the structures of R̥gvedic poetry. We have, however, tried to retain the verse structure as much as possible. All the  translations reproduce the verse divisions found in the hymn, and within verses the  hemistich boundary is also always marked, with the second hemistich beginning  a new line. In fact, as noted above, it has almost always been possible to translate  hemistichs as units without breaching the boundary—an indication of how strong  a compositional element the hemistich was for the poets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>B Format of the Translations</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-footnotes&#34;&gt;No footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most unusual feature of our translation is our decision to avoid the use  of footnotes entirely. We did not begin with that idea, but several considerations  led us to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, the notes in Geldner’s translation, especially the parallels he cites,  are full and informative, and interested readers should consult them: knowledge of  German is not required for tracking down the parallels.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Further, this translation  will appear approximately coincident with the new Witzel-Gotō translation into  German, which contains annotations to verses that build on Geldner’s work. Yet  another set of similar annotations seemed to us unnecessary and redundant.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second and more important, however, this decision reflects our view of the text.  One of the aims of this translation is to demonstrate that the hymns are unified,  structured compositions and not merely collections of single verses randomly collected into hymns. Our emphasis on the integrity and structure of R̥gvedic hymns,  on the idea that the sūkta is the essential compositional unit, is to us the most persuasive reason to avoid footnotes, endnotes, or running commentary. If we were to  invite readers to turn away from the progress of the hymn toward notes of one kind  or another, we would risk causing them to lose precisely the thing we most want our  readers to have, the sense of the hymn as a compositional whole.+++(4)+++&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;hymn-introductions&#34;&gt;Hymn introductions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The starkness of our presentation is softened by several different strategies,  corresponding to different types of problems the text presents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this project, we two translators each took primary responsibility for approximately half the hymns of the R̥gveda and produced first and usually  second drafts of them. As the project continued, we consulted with each other at  every turn, passed hymns back and forth, and read each other’s translations critically. In the end, however, the final version of each hymn became the responsibility  of a single translator. The division of those final versions is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
