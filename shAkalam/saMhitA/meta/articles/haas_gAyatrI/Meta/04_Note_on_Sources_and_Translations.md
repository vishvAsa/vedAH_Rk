title = "04 Note on Sources and Translations"

+++

Abbreviations of cited or quoted primary sources \(such as ṚV or Rām.\) are generally introduced at their first occurrence, except when they occur as references or within lists; all such abbreviations can be looked up in the section “Primary Sources and Translations” in the Bibliography. References to translations can generally be looked up under the respective source text in the same section; bibliographical entries are either given there \(if taken from a dedicated translation of a work, or of a portion of a work\) or in the “Secondary Literature” 

section of the Bibliography. Hyperlinks in the PDF should always lead to the right target. 

To facilitate access to the original texts, this study contains numerous references to existing translations \(usually in brackets and marked with “tr.” or

“trs.”\). However, I have not included these references systematically or for all texts. There are therefore two important points to note here: First, reference to a translation does not imply that it was the basis for a claim made – the study is based throughout on my own reading of the sources – or that it is a particularly good or accurate translation. Second, the absence of a reference does not mean that no translation exists for a particular passage. 

Unless otherwise indicated, all translations are my own. Since I am not a native English speaker, they may sometimes appear clumsy or stylistically unattractive. I hope, however, that the reasons for my deviations from existing translations will become clear once the background of my argumentation and the secondary literature are considered.
