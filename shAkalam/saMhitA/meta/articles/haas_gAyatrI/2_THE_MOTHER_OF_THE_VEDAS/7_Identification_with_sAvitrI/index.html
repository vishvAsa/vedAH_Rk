  <meta property="og:description" content="Introduction
Chapter 6 focused on the deification of the Gāyatrī-Mantra itself, considering its association or even identification with other deities (the deified gāyatrī meter; Sarasvatī) only insofar as they were relevant to this process. In this chapter, the approach differs in that it hones in on one specific deity that, I argue, had a vital impact on the deification of the GM. The origins of this deity extend far back to a time long before the Indo-Aryans immigrated to South Asia in the second millennium bce. In various forms and under various names, it had already existed for thousands of years prior to the GM’s elevation to divine status. By the time it first came into contact with the GM, it was called Sāvitrī, just like the mantra itself. This chapter is devoted to retracing the history and prehistory of this goddess, and to showing how she became entangled with the foremost sāvitrī.">

  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Chapter 6 focused on the deification of the Gāyatrī-Mantra itself, considering its association or even identification with other deities (the deified gāyatrī  meter; Sarasvatī) only insofar as they were relevant to this process. In this chapter, the approach differs in that it hones in on one specific deity that, I argue, had a vital impact on the deification of the GM. The origins of this deity extend far back to a time long before the Indo-Aryans immigrated to South Asia in the second millennium bce. In various forms and under various names, it had already existed for thousands of years prior to the GM’s elevation to divine status. By the time it first came into contact with the GM, it was called Sāvitrī, just like the mantra itself. This chapter is devoted to retracing the history and prehistory of this goddess, and to showing how she became entangled with the foremost sāvitrī.</p>
<p>In addition to this new approach and perspective, the nature of the source texts also changes in this chapter. Thus far, we have primarily dealt with the literature of ritual: virtually all of the texts examined either give instructions for the implementation of rituals or contain the texts or mantras to be recited in them. It is, however, in various kinds of narratives that the goddess Sāvitrī</p>
<p>most often appears.</p>
<p>While ritual manuals are generally meant to be taken literally – or at least, seriously, if only for the sake of the ritual’s success – the same is not necessarily true for narratives. If we encounter a certain deity in an episode of the MBh, for instance, we cannot directly jump to the conclusion that this deity was actually worshipped, or even believed to be real, by either the author(s), the redactor(s), or their congenial audience. On the other hand, texts that are generally categorized as fiction may not only reflect, but even contribute to and create, religious realities in a number of ways. This, for instance, applies to much of the material incorporated into the MBh: many of the epic tales were meant to entertain and, at the same time, to inform and instruct. What people really believed – or believed for some time, believed in certain contexts, believed as long as they were</p>
<p>202 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas</p>
<p>not asked, or pretended to believe – is a very complex issue. It is not always possible to know whether and to what extent a particular deity or practice was or became part of the lived religion.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Introduction,⁸⁶³ in the case of the Sanskrit Epics, the religious authority ascribed to them increased over the course of time. This is evidenced above all by their medieval categorization as Smṛti, a term that was first used in the meaning of “tradition,” then to specifically denote authoritative Dharma literature, and finally came to be applied to many kinds of authoritative, non-Vedic literature.⁸⁶⁴ As Smṛti, the Epics were less authoritative than Śruti, the “aural transmission” of Vedic knowledge – yet authoritative nonethe-less.⁸⁶⁵ It can be assumed that this also affected the status of certain divinities mentioned in them, which were perhaps more readily accepted as real beings by recipients of a later period than by their creators.</p>
<p>The present chapter primarily collects the information that can be gleaned from the literature and presents it in as much detail as possible. The scope of the chapter ranges from the first centuries ce back to the early-Vedic period (and in considering the PIE prehistory of the goddess, even beyond that). The few relevant text passages stretch across this rather vast period of time, which makes it impossible to reconstruct any sort of coherent history. As Sāvitrī appears to have led her divine life mostly outside the textual domain, this often requires an imagination that goes beyond the texts, sometimes even quite far. Several gaps remain, including even such salient events as the change of name from Sūryā to Sāvitrī. However, I will not refrain from at least attempting to draw lines between the dots.</p>
<p>The four main sections of this chapter strictly follow an order that reflects the chronology of the texts studied:</p>
<p>• **Section 1 **(pp. 204–208) discusses what I believe is the earliest form or precursor of the goddess Sāvitrī: the Vedic goddess Sūryā, who in turn likely had a PIE precursor. Sūryā, generally considered Savitṛ’s daughter, 863 See above p. 33.</p>
<p>864 See Brick 2006.</p>
<p>865 Klaus (2011) defines Śruti and Smṛti and summarizes the relationship between them thus: “The term śruti  usually denotes the Veda or, more precisely, the Vedic Saṃhitās and Brāhmanas together with the Āraṇyakas and Upaniṣads, whereas smṛti  primarily denotes the Dharmaśāstras and Vedic Sūtras, as well as the epics (Mahābhārata) and Purānas [sic] along with various fundamental philosophical and scientific texts. […] The smṛti  texts that stand alongside them [i.e., the Śruti texts] had human authors and therefore are not authoritative per se, but they are ‘rooted in the Veda,’ i.e. they are based on śruti  texts, so that dharma  can nevertheless be deduced from them. Since it is possible that some śruti  texts have been lost, a smṛti  passage does not lose its authority if it cannot be associated with the extant śruti  texts. A smṛti  passage can be ignored only if it directly contradicts a surviving śruti  passage or contains clear evidence that it reflects only particular secular interests.”</p>

<p>was connected with a certain “mytheme”:⁸⁶⁶ like other “solar maidens,” she played the role of the ideal bride. As such, she was not only very beautiful, but she was also known for choosing her bridegroom herself.</p>
<p>• **Section 2 **(pp. 208–212) turns to the later fate of Sūryā, who, after the composition of the Ṛgvedic hymns, also came to be called Sūryā Sāvitrī. A number of relevant passages from the Brāhmaṇas are discussed here, including one where a possible variant of Sūryā Sāvitrī, called Sītā Sāvitrī, plays the role of the self-determined bride.</p>
<p>• **Section 3 **(pp. 212–222) deals with the epic Sāvitrī story, arguably the earliest explicit evidence for an anthropomorphic goddess called Sāvitrī who is associated with the sāvitrī  mantra. In <strong>3.1</strong>, the identity of this goddess is examined in detail; there I argue that her nexus with the Vedic Sūryā</p>
<p>Sāvitrī is stronger than her association with the sāvitrī  mantra. This is not only suggested by her characterization as Savitṛ’s daughter, but also by the presence of the marriage theme in the Sāvitrī story: like her divine</p>
<p>“patron,” the princess Sāvitrī, too, is a beautiful bride who chooses her husband herself. **3.2 **also deals with the various male characters the goddess and princess were associated with, which makes it possible to outline a chronological development of the divine figure(s).</p>
<p>• **Section 4 **(pp. 223–226) essentially proposes that the association of the goddess Sāvitrī with the sāvitrī  formula in the epic story may have been meant as a joke. While not claiming that this is the only valid interpretation, I believe that the connection of the goddess and the mantra, when it was first made, may have been so unexpected – at least for some recipients – that it had a comical aspect to it. At the same time, I do not deny that the story also reflects the beginning of a new phase in the deification of the GM.</p>
<p>866 The word “mytheme” (or “mythème”) was coined by structuralist Claude Lévi-Strauss (1958: 233) to denote the “gross constituent units” of a myth (1955: 431). Lévi-Strauss saw mythemes as analogues to phonemes in language; myths consist of a variety of mythemes. I here use it to denote typical and recurring combinations of mythical characters, the relationships between them, and actions and events associated with them.</p>
<p>204 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas</p>
<p><strong>1. Sūryā</strong></p>
<p>In the ṚV,⁸⁶⁷ we encounter Sūryā ( sūryā́), a morning goddess who is (depending on the source) the daughter of Savitṛ or of the sun god Sūrya.⁸⁶⁸ Being the daughter of Savitṛ, she later also came to be called Sūryā Sāvitrī ( sāvitrī  meaning</p>
<p>“Savitṛ’s daughter” or “descendant”). Sūryā, or Sūryā Sāvitrī, should however be strictly distinguished from the sāvitrī  mantras or the epic character Sāvitrī: there is no indication that she was, in the ṚV or other early-Vedic texts, associated with any single mantra at all (let alone the GM), nor that was she a princess like Aśvapati’s daughter in the MBhār.</p>
<p>While in later times it was generally Savitṛ who came to be acknowledged as Sūryā’s father, the name Sūryā Sāvitrī can be found nowhere in the ṚV itself, but was only later attached to one of its hymns, because in this hymn, it is Savitṛ</p>
<p>who is presumably Sūryā’s father.⁸⁶⁹ It appears, however, that the question of Sūryā’s father was not yet clearly settled in the early-Vedic religion – most likely, because it was only of secondary importance. She was clearly not always considered the daughter of the sun: Savitṛ was only later (and, as a god, never completely) conflated with Sūrya, the deification of the sun.⁸⁷⁰</p>
<p>In fact, Sūryā was less defined by her parentage – Prajāpati, too, was later said to be her father⁸⁷¹ – than by her own characteristics and a particular</p>
<p>“mytheme.” In the Vedic religion, Sūryā represented the archetypical bride. In the ṚV, a variety of husbands are named, among them Soma, Pūṣan, and the two Aśvins, who in other cases are also her “wooers” ( vará s) and arrange her marriage.⁸⁷² At the center of Sūryā’s mytheme is the famous “Wedding Hymn,”</p>
<p>ṚV X 85, a rather long and intricate hymn that, so as not to exceed the scope of this chapter, will not be translated here.⁸⁷³ As Sūryā is the bride par excellence, her wedding could be expected to be exemplary, too. In the Wedding Hymn, however, there is not only one bridegroom, but three: one after the other, Soma, Gandharva, and Agni are said to be Sūryā’s bridegrooms. How is this to be understood?</p>
<p>867 ṚV I 167, 184 (see also 119, where ūrjā́nī  probably designates Sūryā); IV 43–45; V 73; VI 58, 63; VII 68; VIII 8, 22, 29; X 26, 85.</p>
<p>868 The goddess Night is once said in the AV to be Savitṛ’s “lively woman” and “young woman belonging to the house” (AV XIX 49.1a: iṣirā́ yóṣā yuvatír dámūnā [tr. Whitney 1905: 979]); cf. Falk 1988: 13. Perhaps she could be envisaged as Sūryā’s mother? It should also be noted that in MBh I 60.34 (tr. van Buitenen I: 149), Savitṛ’s wife is once said to be Tvāṣṭrī; their sons in this case are the Aśvins.</p>
<p>869 On account of the fact that Savitṛ is said to give her to her husband, a role normally assumed by the father; see ṚV X 85.9 (cf. also 13).</p>

<p>According to Oberlies, the three husbands correspond to the three phases of an (early) Vedic wedding: during the “wooing” or engagement, her husband is Soma; when she is brought to her new home, she is in the hands of the Gandharva; and at the wedding proper, she is associated with Agni.⁸⁷⁴ The appearance of several spouses in Sūryā’s wedding is probably part of a stylistic strategy that serves to “aggrandize” Sūryā’s wedding by elaborating on its various stages and by illuminating it from a divine point of view. No real polyandry must be assumed in this case.⁸⁷⁵</p>
<p>Besides that alleged polyandry, however, there is another aspect that makes Sūryā and her wedding special. Jamison has argued that Sūryā’s famous marriage is probably a kind of mythical “prototype” of the so-called svayáṃvara  marriage, in which the bride herself chooses her bridegroom.⁸⁷⁶ As shown by formulaic expressions in other hymns of the ṚV, Sūryā’s self-choice is very significant to her characterization. This may perhaps be unexpected: this epitome of the ideal bride – known for choosing her husband herself –</p>
<p>stands quite in contrast to the traditional Indian way of letting one’s parents and relatives arrange one’s marriage.⁸⁷⁷</p>
<p>We will see below that this motif also reappeared in the epic Sāvitrī</p>
<p>story.⁸⁷⁸ Before turning to her later development, however, I will briefly discuss two other aspects that are important for understanding the Vedic Sūryā: her parallels in other IE cultures as well as her potential manifestation in nature (which, incidentally, again throws up the question of who she is being married to).</p>
<p>Sūryā’s role as the ideal bride, her self-choice, and especially her association with the two Aśvins are often mentioned or alluded to in the Ṛgvedic hymns.⁸⁷⁹ This mytheme most likely had a PIE precursor (see Figure 7): the</p>
<p>“daughter of the sun” or “sun maiden” as a very sought-after bride can also be found in the mythologies of other IE peoples.⁸⁸⁰ She is generally characterized by great beauty, which often leads to rivalry for her hand, and is associated with twins. In Baltic mythology, for instance, the two sons of God (as well as other deities) – the dieva dēli  or dievo sunēliai (Latvian/Lithuanian) – are the suitors of saules meita  or saulēs dukterys, the “sun’s daughter” (note that in this case the sun itself is female as well). As in Sūryā’s case, songs about her were sung at weddings.</p>

<p>Probably the clearest parallel, however, is to be found in Greek mythology, where we find the goddess⁸⁸¹ and epic character Helen, the sister of the two Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux (the counterparts of the Aśvins). In the Iliad, she is married to Menelaus and abducted by Paris, but both Menelaus and his brother Agamemnon set out to retrieve her. While in Greek mythology, Helen is almost never said to be the daughter of the sun, but of Zeus, her name has often been connected with Helios, the Greek sun god, and with the word ἑλάνη</p>
<p>helánē (or ἑλένη helénē), “torch,” and she has been associated with “shining beauty” or interpreted to be a “Mistress of Sunlight.”⁸⁸² Jamison also suggested a derivation from * u̯elh1,⁸⁸³ the PIE predecessor of the root vṛ/ vṝ “to choose,”</p>
<p>and emphasized that when she was to be wed, Helen could choose her husband, too.⁸⁸⁴ Ultimately, however, there is no consensus on the etymology and meaning of Helen’s name.⁸⁸⁵</p>

<p>**Figure 7: **From the PIE solar maiden to Sūryā</p>
<p>The same is also true for Sūryā, whose name is obviously in some way related to that of Sūrya, the “sun.” As in the case of her father, Savitṛ,⁸⁸⁶ scholars have made several attempts to establish a connection between her and a celestial body or phenomenon. This has not always been the sun itself. In fact, she has often been identified with Uṣas, the goddess (of) Dawn.⁸⁸⁷ This identification was already doubted by Oldenberg, above all because unlike Sūryā, Uṣas is always said to be the daughter of Heaven ( divó duhitā́) – and not of Savitṛ</p>

<p>chapteR 7 ∙ identification with sāvitRī ∙ 207</p>
<p>or the sun.⁸⁸⁸ According to Oberlies, “Sūryā, as the daughter of the (old) sun, seems to be a personification of the sun at the intersection of day and night in the morning.”⁸⁸⁹ In a later publication, Oberlies asserted that Sūryā is the goddess of the gray heaven or twilight before  dawn proper (and not the deification of the morning sun).⁸⁹⁰ He based this identification on the observation that the Aśvins, Sūryā’s wooers, are associated with the time between night and day.</p>
<p>Recently, further arguments have been put forward for an explicit identification of Sūryā and the sun.⁸⁹¹ In the Wedding Hymn, Sūryā’s (principal) husband is Soma, who is here for the first time given lunar attributes. Assuming that Soma is to be identified with the moon, the thought suggested itself to some scholars that his partner Sūryā might be a kind of sun goddess. On the basis of these identifications, it has been argued that Sūryā’s wedding might have been represented by the amāvāsyā̀, the night (and the following day) of the new moon, which occurs when the moon and the sun roughly have the same eclip-tic longitude, and set and rise at about the same time.⁸⁹² This conjunction of celestial bodies might have been interpreted as a marriage (a “conjugal event”).</p>
<p>According to Junko Sakamoto-Gotō,</p>
<p>The marriage of the moon (king Soma) and the Sun goddess Sūryā (daughter of Savitr̥) symbolizes the conjunction of the moon and the sun; their wedding implies the New Moon Sacrifice (str.3-5 [i.e., ṚV X 85.3–5]), which is further combined with the rituals such as the Animal Sacrifice at the summer or winter solstice (str.13 […]).⁸⁹³</p>
<p>However, while words in ā  typically designate the feminine form and female version of those ending in a, there is little evidence that sūryā́ ⁸⁹⁴ was really understood as a “female sun” or “sun goddess.” To my knowledge, there are no unambiguous Vedic references supporting Sūryā’s identification with the (morning) sun itself. The texts themselves never explicitly mention or suggest any such identification – the only thing they sometimes  do mention is that she is the sun’s daughter,⁸⁹⁵ but not the sun itself.</p>
<p>We may of course suspect that Sūryā might have been seen in several celestial objects or phenomena, depending on the poet and the context – but if 888 See Oldenberg II: 53 ad ṚV VII 69.1; cf. also Zeller 1990: 101, n. 605.</p>
<p>889 Translation of Oberlies 1993: 175: “Sūryā  scheint als ‚Tocher der [alten] Sonne‘ eine Per-sonifikation der Sonne am morgendlichen Schnittpunkt von Tag und Nacht zu sein”</p>
<p>(square brackets in the original).</p>
<p>890 Oberlies I: 240 and 2012: 173.</p>
<p>891 This has also been argued, for instance, by Ehni (1879: 170) and Falk (1988: 31–32).</p>
<p>892 At the actual time of this conjunction, the moon is of course invisible, as the sun outshines it; the new moon is the first visible crescent of the moon after  the conjunction.</p>
<p>893 Sakamoto-Gotō 2010: 1122.</p>

<p>208 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas</p>
<p>this was the case, we cannot determine which one.⁸⁹⁶ In the Vedic period, only her association with the morning is beyond doubt, an association which is also backed up by IE mythology.⁸⁹⁷ Even if one insists on interpreting her marriage with Soma as an astronomical event, her association with the early morning would, in my view, be sufficient: the last time the (waning) moon can be seen is in the early morning.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sūryā Sāvitrī</strong></p>
<p>Let us now turn to Sūryā’s development in later Vedic and Sanskrit texts. Evidently, she remained prominent as the archetypical bride also after the ṚV. For instance, various places in the AV briefly allude to the marriage of Sūryā.⁸⁹⁸ In book XIV, we find an even longer wedding hymn in which many verses of the Ṛgvedic Wedding Hymn are reused.⁸⁹⁹</p>
<p>The myth is taken up again in the Brāhmaṇas too. Here, it is either Savitṛ or Prajāpati who hands Sūryā Sāvitrī over to Soma, and gives the thousand verses of the so-called Āśvina-Śastra, a certain litany that is recited by the Hotṛ,⁹⁰⁰</p>
<p>as a kind of dowry. The <strong>AitB</strong>, for instance, recounts: “Verily, Prajāpati gave a daughter to king Soma: Sūryā Sāvitrī. All of the gods came to her as wooers.⁹⁰¹ He gave her these one thousand [verses] as dowry, which they call the</p>
<p>‘Āśvina[-Śastra]’ here.”⁹⁰² The passage contains a contradiction: while Prajāpati is obviously the father of Sūryā, she is nevertheless called Sūryā Sāvitrī. While in the course of time Prajāpati took over many functions of Savitṛ (and, indeed, of many gods),⁹⁰³ it would be hasty to conclude that the two gods are tacitly 896 Cf. Lommel (1956Lommel 1956: 98. Ultimately, neither the PIE daughter of the sun nor Helen can be clearly identified with a single celestial phenomenon or celestial body; see West 2007: 233–234.</p>
<p>897 Steets 1993: 174–177 and passim.</p>
<p>898 AV VI 82.2 (where Sūryā is also called Sāvitrī), XII 1.24, XX 143.1, and XIV 2.1.</p>
<p>899 AV XIV 1–2 (tr. Whitney 1905: 740–768) ≈ AVP XVIII. For a description of the wedding depicted in this hymn, see Shende 1949: 248–237.</p>
<p>900 For another narrative concerning this Śastra that does not include Sūryā, see PañcB IX</p>
<p>1.34–38 (tr. Caland 1931: 199).</p>
<p>901 The wooers are sent by the groom’s family to that of the bride in order to arrange the marriage (negotiate the bride-price, etc.). It here appears that the gods are indeed Soma’s assistants; however, it might also be the case that the gods actually want her for themselves, but only Soma was successful in obtaining her as his bride.</p>
<p>902 AitB IV 7: prajāpatir vai somāya rājñe duhitaraṃ prāyacchat sūryāṃ sāvitrīm | tasyai sarve devā varā agacchaṃs tasyā etat sahasraṃ vahatum anvākarod yad etad āśvinam ity ācakṣate; also translated by Keith 1920: 444.</p>
<p>903 See above p. 46.</p>

<p>identified in this passage.⁹⁰⁴ Rather, it is more likely that “Sāvitrī” had become a common epithet of Sūryā, which was kept when the author of the passage decided to make Prajāpati her father.</p>
<p>The contradiction was recognized by one of the authors of the <strong>KauṣB</strong>, who most likely knew the older passage in the AitB.⁹⁰⁵ He replaced Prajāpati with Savitṛ and omitted the designation “Sāvitrī,” while hinting at the possibility that (according to another account) Prajāpati might have been her father:</p>
<p>“Now when Savitṛ gave Sūryā to king Soma – or, alternatively, it was Prajāpati –</p>
<p>he gave the daughter these thousand [verses] when she was being married.”⁹⁰⁶</p>
<p>In both passages, the Āśvina-Śastra is said to be the dowry of Sūryā. What is significant is that this particular Śastra is regularly recited at dawn, before sunrise, at the end of an atirātra  or “overnight” ritual. This shows that not only the Aśvins, but also Sūryā and her wedding continued to be associated with the early morning.</p>
<p>In a passage from the <strong>TaittB</strong>, one of the earliest Brāhmaṇas,⁹⁰⁷ we encounter another Sāvitrī, a girl called Sītā Sāvitrī. The relationship between Sītā</p>
<p>Sāvitrī and Sūryā Sāvitrī is not clear; however, there can be little doubt that they (or at least their stories) are connected in some way. I translate the passage here in full:</p>
<p>Prajāpati emitted king Soma. After him the three Vedas were emitted. He</p>
<p>[i.e., Soma] took them in his hand.</p>
<p>Now, Sītā Sāvitrī desired king Soma, but he desired Śraddhā.⁹⁰⁸ She approached father Prajāpati and said to him: “Obeisance to you, sir! I shall approach you, |1| I resort to you: verily, I desire king Soma, but he desires Śraddhā.”</p>
<p>After providing her with an ornament made of fragrant powder, explaining the Ten-Hotṛ [i.e., the Ten-Hotṛ Litany] from the east, the Four-Hotṛ</p>
<p>904 Ehni (1879: 170) thought that sāvitrī  here invokes Savitṛ’s typical function as initiator and impeller (cf. also Varenne’s translation “l’‘incitatrice’”). This argument is made im-plausible by the fact that the sense of “female descendant of Savitṛ” was well established for the word sāvitrī. For the possibility of linguistic anomalies in the names of deities, however, see West 2007: 134–135.</p>
<p>905 The later KauṣB in many ways depends on, or is derived from, the AitB; see Keith 1920: 22–28.</p>
<p>906 KauṣB XVIII 1: atha yatra ha tat savitā sūryāṃ prāyacchat somāya rājñe | yadi vā × prajāpatiḥ | tat sahasram anvākarod duhitra ūhyamānāyai; the conjecture prajāpatiḥ  was suggested by Weber (1862: 364–365, n. 3) and Caland (1931: 199); the edition has yadi vā</p>
<p>prajāpateḥ (“or, alternatively, [she may have been the daughter] of Prajāpati’s”). Also translated by Keith 1920: 202.</p>
<p>907 Witzel 1995a: 5, n. 20.</p>
<p>908 Literally, śraddhā́  is “trust” or “belief” in the efficacy of the ritual; this abstract concept is personified in the story. According to the commentary, Śraddhā is another daughter of Prajāpati’s. For the personified śraddhā́  in Vedic literature, see also Joshi 1973: 51–53.</p>

<p>Having beheld her, he said: “Turn to me!” She said to him: “Pray, reveal to me [your object of] enjoyment! Reveal to me that which is in your hand!”</p>
<p>So he gave her the three Vedas. Therefore/ ever since, women procure enjoyment for themselves.</p>
<p>Whoever desires someone, says: “May I be a darling [i.e., the darling of the desired person]!” |3| and, respectively, about whom one desires, one says: “May he be a darling [i.e., my darling]!” Therefore, after providing this ornament made of fragrant powder, explaining the Ten-Hotṛ [Litany, etc., as above] …, she should go to his side [i.e., the bride should go to the groom’s side]. A darling will he become. |4|⁹¹²</p>
<p>This passage, which to my knowledge does not have any parallels in Vedic literature, requires some further explanation. In order to achieve even a preliminary understanding of the narrative, it is necessary to identify the ritual elements and references contained in it.</p>
<p>A much later text, the Āgniveśya-Gṛhyasūtra (ĀgnGS), shows that the various “Hotṛ Litanies” as well as the “ornament made of fragrant powder” are part of the extended wedding ceremony.⁹¹³ In this Sūtra, the ritual involves both the bride and the husband. In the Brāhmaṇa, on the other hand, it is not entirely clear whether it is already part of the actual wedding of Sītā and Soma or whether it is even meant to attract him. Its purpose, in any case, is to make the 909 For the various texts containing these litanies, see WaR: 77, 67, 86, 126, and 120.</p>

<p>girl attractive to her husband.⁹¹⁴ The logic is that if someone wishes to become another person’s priyá – their “darling” – one has to be sufficiently attractive for that person. Conversely, this will also make them one’s own “darling.”</p>
<p>In the story, this procedure is successful: as I imagine it, Sītā sits or stands by Soma’s side, only half visible (perhaps because both are looking forward).</p>
<p>When asked to face him and thus show herself in all her beauty, she asks him to show her what is in his hand – a demand he obviously fulfils. Sītā thus even manages to make Soma give her his prized possession, the three Vedas.⁹¹⁵ This not only shows the great value of the Vedas, but also of the various texts “adorning” the bride. Moreover, it gives rise to the observation that women in general are intent on procuring enjoyments for themselves.</p>
<p>Turning to the main protagonists of the story, we again observe that Sītā</p>
<p>is called Sāvitrī even though she is obviously Prajāpati’s daughter. While the fact that she becomes the wife of king Soma naturally suggests an affinity to Sūryā Sāvitrī, it is entirely unclear what their relationship would be and why Sītā is called Sāvitrī. In fact, it is not even clear who Sītā is: well known from the Sanskrit Epics as Rāma’s virtuous wife, she is barely mentioned in Vedic literature.⁹¹⁶ Whatever the case might be, however, for the time being it remains unknown as to whether there is any reason for Sūryā’s replacement by Sītā</p>
<p>other than a misspelling or a change made by a later redactor.</p>
<p>The conclusions that can be drawn from this story are very limited. It is conspicuous, however, that Sītā Sāvitrī, too, chooses her husband herself. The typical terminology associated with a “self-choice” may be missing: the passage neither contains the verb vṛ  nor the noun svayáṃvara. But the initiative clearly comes from Sītā Sāvitrī, who eventually attracts Soma through her beauty. It therefore appears that this passage is in some way related to the Sūryā myth-complex, even though Sūryā herself is de facto  not mentioned (see Figure 8).</p>
<p>After this somewhat long digression, let us return to Sūryā and her fate in later periods. Unfortunately, we come to a relatively abrupt abyss here. In contrast to the Vedic literature, the name Sūryā does not appear very often in later Sanskrit texts: In the Gṛhyasūtras, she is only mentioned in the context of weddings. Some Sūtras mention a verse that should be recited while the cou-914 Note also that, since the bride is essentially purchased  by the husband (at least in the so-called śaulka  or “price-”types of marriage), her adornment can be seen as part of the arrangement; cf. Jamison 1996: 213–215.</p>
<p>915 According to Pradhan (1988: 31), this may be a “relic of the practice of kanyā-śulka,” that is, the “bride price.”</p>
<p>916 See Macdonell 2002 [¹1916]: 138 and Joshi 1973: 48. It should perhaps be noted that, at least in Vālmīki’s Rām., the epic Sītā becomes Rāma’s wife as the result of a svayaṃvara.</p>
<p>This svayaṃvara, however, does not involve any choosing on her part (cf. n. 957 on p. 221 below). Moreover, it appears to have been a “an interrupted, disappointing, and even failed one between the suitors’ departure and Rāma’s arrival long after, with no rivals remaining” Hiltebeitel 2018.</p>

<p>has achieved widespread recognition as a showcase for the ideal of a pativratā, a wife devoted to her husband. It has even been said that is “perhaps the most celebrated of all the episodes of the Great Epic.”⁹²³ It has inspired numerous retellings (but few adaptations)⁹²⁴ and has been translated and interpreted so often that any attempt to briefly summarize its reception history is bound to fail.⁹²⁵ While it has been categorized as “relatively late,”⁹²⁶ it is in fact unknown when the story came into being; similarities in wording with the MānDhŚ,⁹²⁷</p>
<p>composed around the second century ce, possibly indicates that it is not far distant in time.⁹²⁸</p>
<p>I will briefly retell the story here, including a translation of one select passage. In the analysis I will focus on the possible continuities between the Vedic Sūryā Sāvitrī and the epic Sāvitrī, as well as on the role of the sāvitrī  mantra and its deification.</p>
<p>The story, as narrated by the sage Mārkaṇḍeya, begins with the great king of Madra, Aśvapati, who remained childless for a long time. To remedy his fate, the king began to follow a religious lifestyle, which, among other practices also included the repeated recitation of the sāvitrī  formula. After a long time, this approach began to bear fruit, and the goddess Sāvitrī herself appeared before him. I quote here van Buitenen’s translation of the relevant passage in full:⁹²⁹</p>
<p>[H]e offered oblations a hundred thousand times with the sāvitrī  formula, О best of kings, and forewent his meal every sixth time. /9/</p>
<p>For eighteen years he lived with this life rule, and when the eighteenth year was full, Sāvitrī became contented. /10/ She showed herself [literally “in her own form,” svarūpiṇī] to the king, O prince, arising from the agnihotra with much joy. And the boon-granting Goddess said to the king, /11/ “I am pleased with your continence, purity, restraint, and self-control, and with your wholehearted devotion to me, O king. /12/ Aśvapati, king of the Madras, choose whatever boon you desire, but pay heed at all times to the Law [i.e., Dharma].” /13/</p>

<p>Aśvapati said:</p>
<p>I undertook this effort to obtain a child, out of desire for the Law. May I have many sons, goddess, to prosper my lineage. /14/ If you are pleased with me, goddess, this I choose as my boon. For offspring, as the twice-born [i.e., Brahmins] have told me, is the highest Law. /15/</p>
<p>Sāvitrī said:</p>
<p>I knew before this of this intention of yours, O king, and I have spoken to Grandfather [i.e., Brahmā] in your cause for sons. /16/ By the favor decreed to you on earth by the Self-existent, good man, a splendid girl shall soon be born to you. /17/ And you should make no reply at all to this, for I am pleased and say this to you on behalf of Grandfather. /18/</p>

<p>Sāvitrī grew up and became a woman of unfathomable pulchritude, so beautiful that no suitor dared to ask for her hand.⁹³¹ Because he could not fulfil his duty to marry his daughter off in time, Aśvapati became worried and decided to send her off to find a husband on her own. This she did; her choice, however, fell on a man with a serious shortcoming: prince Satyavat was a good match in every respect, but as the divine messenger Nārada revealed, his fate was to die within a year. Moreover, he was a son of the blind and involuntarily retired king Dyumatsena, who lived with his family in a hermitage. Understandably, Aśvapati initially resisted the choice made by his daughter. Eventually, however, he gave his consent, and Sāvitrī married Satyavat.</p>
<p>As predicted, Yama, the god of death, came after a year to take Satyavat’s soul. Sāvitrī, however, having performed tapas  for three days, insisted on following her husband, and began to argue with Yama. By impressing him with her knowledge of Dharma, she made the god grant her five wishes. She used the first and second wishes for the restoration of her father-in-law’s eyesight and kingdom. Her third wish was for her own father to have a hundred sons, and as her fourth wish, she asked for a hundred sons for herself. With her fifth wish, she made Yama realize that to this end, Satyavat would have to live, and in this way forced him to revive her husband. The couple returned to the hermitage, and in the course of time, all of Sāvitrī’s wishes were fulfilled.</p>
<p>This, in short, is the story of Sāvitrī. As we can see, in the story the princess is portrayed as the ideal wife rather than as the ideal bride. But this is at most a change in emphasis: what Sūryā Sāvitrī and the princess Sāvitrī both have in common is not only their name and their great beauty, but also the remarkable fact that they choose their husbands themselves. These similarities leave little doubt that the epic story is in some way connected to the Vedic myth.</p>
<p>The question is: How exactly? Should we assume literal or “literary” identity between the two Sāvitrīs, or did the story-maker only play with some elements he knew from Vedic lore? And how does the sāvitrī  mantra fit into the story?</p>
<p>The most recent studies dealing with the Sāvitrī complex (in greater detail than offered here) are by Asko Parpola.⁹³² In the fourteenth chapter of his book Deciphering the Indus Script (1994) and in a lengthy paper published four years later in Studia Orientalia,⁹³³ Parpola developed a great number of hypotheses about the Sāvitrī legend and the so-called sāvitrīvrata,⁹³⁴ its predecessors in the 931 According to Brodbeck (2013: 531–532), this was likely intended as some sort of joke.</p>
<p>The real reason why no suitors approached Sāvitrī was that she was an only daughter; as such, any sons born to her would count as the sons of her father rather than of her husband.</p>
<p>932 Some of his ideas were also anticipated by Hermann Lommel (1956) and further developed by Anita C. Ray (1998).</p>
<p>933 Parpola 1998, summarized in a follow-up article in 2000; cf. also Parpola 2002: 366–367.</p>
<p>934 The so-called vaṭa-sāvitrī-vrata  or sāvitrī-vrata  is an annual observance performed by married women to various ends, above all to keep their husbands alive and well and to obtain</p>
<p>216 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas</p>
<p>(according to him, Dravidian-speaking) Indus Valley Civilization as well as various other subjects. His aim was to construct a coherent history of the goddess and/or literary character Sāvitrī – who for him seemed to be a somewhat mono-lithic being – beginning in Harappan times up to medieval South Asia.</p>
<p>Parpola tried to show that Sāvitrī’s relationship with various male characters is often problematic; her father (Savitṛ, Prajāpati, Brahmā, Aśvapati) is often suspected of committing incest and both he and/or her husband (the sun, Soma the moon, Brahmā, Satyavat) are regularly doomed to die (again and again), allegedly in many cases by decapitation.⁹³⁵ Sāvitrī, however, has the power to revive or save them. This motif is reflected in various Vedic and Purāṇic legends, in the Hindu wedding ritual⁹³⁶ as well as in the sāvitrīvrata.  ⁹³⁷ For Parpola, the resemblances found in the narratives and rituals point to the existence of a single underlying structure or theme; the human couple of Sāvitrī and Satyavat are the analogues to the divine couple Sāvitrī and Brahmā,⁹³⁸ they even “symbolize one and the same thing.”⁹³⁹</p>
<p>Many of Parpola’s theories are highly speculative.⁹⁴⁰ Most problematic are his poorly qualified equations or identifications: even if the various entities called Sāvitrī are connected with each other, expressing these connections in terms of identities can easily suggest relations and developments – mythical as well as historical – that do not actually exist or, respectively, have never taken place.⁹⁴¹ His presentation of the Sāvitrī complex therefore needs to be somewhat revised and refined. In the following, I will only revisit the various Sāvitrīs in the MBh and, in particular, in the Sāvitrī story. In doing so, I will make a sharp distinction between the goddess Sāvitrī, the sāvitrī  mantra, and the princess Sāvitrī. Naturally, my focus will lie on the mantra, the goddess, and their inter-</p>
<p>→</p>
<p>children. In texts to be recited in this ritual, Sāvitrī above all appears as a divine version of the princess, the ideal, devout wife (Satyavat, too, is worshipped). This role is also projected onto the “original” Sāvitrī, Brahmā’s wife, who as such is occasionally also called Gāyatrī and Mother of the Vedas. However, her worship apparently does not include the recitation of the GM by the female worshipper herself, and her nature as the deification of the mantra is clearly only secondary.

<p>941 To give but one of the most striking equations/identifications: “The dying husband is the</p>
<p>‘old sun’, the ‘old year’ (Prince Satyavat dies after one year has passed since his the [sic]</p>
<p>wedding). In the daily cycle, this ‘old sun’ is the ‘night sun’, Sāvitrī’s father and husband through incest, Savitṛ = Varuṇa = Yama = Puruṣa = Prajāpati = Brahmā, the ‘first man’</p>
<p>who created all beings by uniting with his own daughter, and who was punished with death for his sin. Thus he was also the first man to die.” Parpola 2000: 206.</p>
<p>chapteR 7 ∙ identification with sāvitRī ∙ 217</p>
<p>relationship. As will be seen, the Vedic Sūryā Sāvitrī probably plays a role here too.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 The goddess</strong></p>
<p>The story does not provide too many details about the goddess Sāvitrī. After her brief appearance in the narration of Sāvitrī’s birth, she is mentioned only once again. When princess Sāvitrī returns with Satyavat to their hermitage, Gautama, one of the ascetics living there, says to her: “I want to hear it, Sāvitrī, because you know the whole extent of it: I know that you, Sāvitrī, are like Sāvitrī in splendor ( tejas).”⁹⁴² This statement indicates that the princess Sāvitrī shares an important quality with her eponym: splendor. Apart from that, it does not really add to our knowledge about the goddess herself.</p>
<p>The goddess indeed seems to play only a supporting role. In fact, one might even think that the author invented her ad-hoc:⁹⁴³ the practice of repetitively reciting the sāvitrī  mantra was widespread at the time, as was the notion that the mantra is, in many ways, special, or to some degree even divine. Personifying the mantra as the “mother of the initiate,” for instance, was not uncommon,⁹⁴⁴</p>
<p>and texts like the JaimUB exalted and perhaps even deified it to some extent. As I will discuss in some more detail below, the author certainly found no trouble in making up religious practices. Why not let a mantra appear in front of a devout reciter in the form of a beautiful, benevolent goddess?</p>
<p>Some of these factors might indeed have influenced the author. There are, however, many indications that the goddess Sāvitrī was, in fact, the successor of the Vedic Sūryā Sāvitrī, and not only the product of “religious fiction.” This is first of all suggested by her association with Brahmā, who, as could be shown, is the Hindu “successor” of Prajāpati, the great Vedic creator god.⁹⁴⁵ While it is not entirely clear how this deity emerged, it is evident that over the course of time, many of Prajāpati’s characteristics were transferred to Brahmā. Against the background of this development, I believe it is possible to make an argument based on analogy.</p>
<p>As we saw above, Sūryā Sāvitrī was also suspected to be Prajāpati’s daughter. If Brahmā is the successor of Prajāpati – or rather, his epic manifestation –</p>
<p>it would make sense that Sāvitrī continues Sūryā Sāvitrī, from whom she even 942 MBh III 282.34: śrotum icchāmi sāvitri tvaṃ hi vettha parāvaram / tvāṃ hi jānāmi sāvitri sāvitrīm iva tejasā //.</p>
<p>943 As I myself assumed earlier: “Since Sāvitrī only briefly appears after the repetition of her mantra by king Aśvapati, it cannot be ruled out that at that time she was a literary character created ‘ad-hoc’ rather than a goddess who was actually worshipped and had her own cult.” Haas 2019a: 14.</p>
<p>944 See above pp. 181–182.</p>
<p>945 In the MBh, “Brahmā and Prajāpati are simply two names for one and the same deity”</p>
<p>Sullivan 1994: 379. For more details, see Bailey 1983: 63–76.</p>
<p>218 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas</p>
<p>may have derived her name. Sāvitrī would, therefore, be Brahmā’s daughter. The relationship between the various male and female deities, however, is not necessarily that straightforward: Is Sāvitrī Brahmā’s daughter, or is she his wife? As a matter of fact, a goddess called Sāvitrī was at some point identified with Sarasvatī – Brahmā’s most famous consort⁹⁴⁶ – and is even explicitly called Brahmā’s wife in at least one other passage of the MBh.⁹⁴⁷</p>
<p>The Vedic Sūryā Sāvitrī, on the other hand, was never the wife of Prajāpati, Brahmā’s precursor. In contrast to many other myths, where Prajāpati himself makes an attempt to unite with one of his daughters,⁹⁴⁸ the Vedic Sūryā Sāvitrī</p>
<p>always becomes the wife of Soma. In the Sāvitrī story itself, virtually nothing is said about Sāvitrī’s relationship with Brahmā. While she does call him “Grandfather” ( pitāmaha), this does not necessarily imply that he is her grandfather in actuality; indeed, like Prajāpati, Brahmā is the progenitor of all beings.⁹⁴⁹ It is, therefore, certainly possible to interpret Sāvitrī as the wife of Brahmā, and perhaps as Savitṛ’s daughter. But was that a general belief?</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, we have to take a closer look at how Sāvitrī is characterized in the Great Epic. In my view, the MBh also shows traces of the ancient Sāvitrī, who does not necessarily play the role of Brahmā’s wife and who is also not first and foremost a deified form of the mantra. There are strong reasons to believe that this Sāvitrī was also involved in the Sāvitrī story.</p>
<p>First of all, two passages in the Epic imply that Sāvitrī is Savitṛ’s daughter, as is the case in the KauṣB and probably also in the ṚV. When Lomapāda marries his daughter Śāntā to the ascetic Ṛśyaśṛṅga, for instance, this act is likened to Savitṛ’s giving Sāvitrī away, leaving little doubt that the author thought Sāvitrī to be Savitṛ’s daughter.⁹⁵⁰ In the Ādiparvan, there is a story about Sāvitrī’s younger sister, who is called Tapatī, literally the “warming” or “torching one.”⁹⁵¹ Like her, she is a beautiful daughter of Savitṛ’s, who here is not differentiated at all from Sūrya, the sun.⁹⁵² No mention is made of Brahmā or the sāvitrī  mantra. What 946 In the MBh, however, Sarasvatī is his daughter; see Ludvik 2007: 116.</p>
<p>947 MBh XIII 134.3a: sāvitrī brahmaṇaḥ sādhvī.</p>
<p>948 For summaries and further references, see Ludvik 2007: 63–72. For incest myths involving Brahmā, see Bailey 1983: 118–121.</p>
<p>949 Bailey 1983: 121–23. Cf. also Bailey 1983: 120: “Despite Brahma’s strongly paternalistic character and his paternal roles, there are very few passages in the epics where he is accompanied by his wife.”</p>
<p>950 MBh III 110.5: nivartiteṣu sasyeṣu yasmai śāntāṃ dadau nṛpaḥ / lomapādo duhitaraṃ sāvitrīṃ savitā yathā //. Brodbeck (2009: 83) points out that this marriage, too, might involve a putrikā  aspect (on which see below p. 221).</p>
<p>951 Her story is told in MBh I 160–163 (tr. van Buitenen I: 324–329); cf. Gombach 2000: 47.</p>
<p>952 Savitṛ/Sūrya decides to marry her to king Saṃvaraṇa, who is his devotee; together they have a son, Kuru, an ancestor of Arjuna (who is therefore also called Tāpatya). Interestingly, this story mentions that, like Aśvapati, Savitṛ is worried when thinking about marrying Tapatī off (I 160.11). A star passage (*1722.1) adds that she is sixteen years old: by Dharmaśāstric standards, her father should probably already have taken care of her</p>
<p>chapteR 7 ∙ identification with sāvitRī ∙ 219</p>
<p>stands out is the beauty of the radiant, “solar” bride (a quality obviously shared by Tapatī and Sāvitrī) and the theme of marriage.</p>
<p>The most obvious evidence for the continuation of the Sūryā Sāvitrī</p>
<p>mytheme, however, is that of the Sāvitrī story itself. That the epic princess has to find a husband for herself also means that she has to choose him herself. In my view, this points to a nexus with the Ṛgvedic and Atharvedic Sūryā/ Sūryā</p>
<p>Sāvitrī, who likely was known to have chosen her husband herself, too (possibly in contrast to some of her later versions).⁹⁵³ That her mytheme was probably not forgotten after the Vedic period may also be inferred from the fact that her hymns continued to be recited at weddings.⁹⁵⁴ While the wedding hymns may not have been understood by all in the same way – both because of their language and their partly enigmatic content – the idea of a bride who is so beautiful that she has the freedom to choose her husband herself, may have easily persisted. As in other IE cultures, this may have also included the idea that this radiant bride is somehow related to the sun.</p>

<p>953 Note that in the AitB and KauṣB, self-choice is not mentioned, which however does not necessarily mean that for the authors/recipients it was not in the background. Sītā Sāvitrī</p>
<p>evidently chose her husband herself and managed to attract him by means of her beauty.</p>
<p>954 See above p. 211.</p>
<p>220 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas</p>
<p>It is thus possible to draw a line from the Ṛgvedic goddess Sūryā to the epic goddess Sāvitrī via Sūryā Sāvitrī (see Figure 9). All texts either emphasize her beauty and radiance or associate her with marriage, and a good number of them do both. (Interestingly, the texts never mention any children born by the goddess; the reason for this might be the focus on her role as a bride.) In doing so, I believe they continue and actualize a mytheme already existent in PIE culture.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized, however, that there are also discontinuities, especially with regard to Sāvitrī’s varying fathers and husbands. These will be discussed next.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Husbands, fathers, and the infamous incest</strong></p>
<p>In the ṚV, the identity of Sūryā’s father (Savitṛ/Sūrya) does not appear to be fixed, a circumstance that suggests that he was not (yet) very important. It is only in the AV that she is called Sāvitrī, indicating that Savitṛ is her father.</p>
<p>At this point (I shall call it <strong>stage 1</strong>; see Table 20 below), Sūryā herself and her wedding are clearly in the foreground. Her association with twins is still intact.</p>
<p>While her husband, Soma, does appear and is associated or even identified with the moon, it is difficult to reconstruct an elaborate marriage between the sun and the moon on the basis of the available evidence. Drawing any conclusions about the nature of their union is little more than speculation. A problematic relationship between Sūryā, her father or her husband is, in any case, not dis-cernible at all.</p>
<p>Minor problems begin to arise in what can be called <strong>stage 2</strong>: In the Brāhmaṇas, Sūryā continues to be called Sāvitrī. At the same time, it appears there have been rumors about Prajāpati being her father. One explanation for this is that Prajāpati tended to absorb other deities; Savitṛ in particular was at times simply identified with him. I would like to emphasize, however, that the relationship between Savitṛ/Prajāpati and Sūryā Sāvitrī remained perfectly normal.</p>
<p>The incest myths connected with Prajāpati did not at all affect Sūryā Sāvitrī’s marriage with Soma.</p>
<p>In the next period, <strong>stage 3</strong>, Sūryā Sāvitrī abandons her first name; the reasons for this are unknown. Her biggest appearance is in the Sāvitrī story. To my knowledge, in the non-epic literature of that time she is never mentioned at all (the word sāvitrī  is generally used for the GM). But even the Sanskrit Epics only give sparse information, at least with regard to her “non-mantric”</p>
<p>manifestation: in the constituted text of the MBh, she is mentioned only briefly in a few generally late passages (other than those discussed above), none of which provide any more clues about her.⁹⁵⁵ Soma, Sūryā’s husband, is never 955 In XII 264.10–12, she very briefly appears in order to request an ascetic named Satya to perform an animal sacrifice (for this story, see Gombach 2000: 273–274 and</p>
<p>chapteR 7 ∙ identification with sāvitRī ∙ 221</p>
<p>mentioned. When her father is mentioned, it is Savitṛ, who in these texts is generally equated with Sūrya, the sun god. A problematic father-daughter relationship might be present, but is never mentioned explicitly.⁹⁵⁶</p>

<p>This, of course, cannot be said of the princess Sāvitrī, who causes her father a lot of trouble. This trouble is directly related to the triangular relationship between her, her father, and her husband, and therefore deserves a more detailed discussion. As we will see below, understanding this problem may also have implications for how the presence of the mantra is understood in the story.</p>
<p>The root of the problem lies in Sāvitrī’s self-choice. There can be little doubt that in the eyes of the author, a svayaṃvara  was not how things should ideally work. Even if the story has a happy end, Sāvitrī’s choosing a man who is destined to die within a year must have been an alarming example of what could happen if you let girls decide for themselves. In fact, the Dharmaśāstras generally do not permit svayaṃvara s, at best allowing a girl to choose a husband herself if her father fails to marry her within three years after she has reached puberty.⁹⁵⁷ One moral of the story, therefore, is not to let the situation come to this in the first place.</p>
<p>Assuming a certain Dharmaśāstric momentum in the background of the story is not as unlikely as it may seem at first. Simon Brodbeck has argued that one of the central themes of the story is the “promotion” of the ideal of a</p>
<p>→</p>
<p>Brodbeck 2009: 75–76). In XIII 66.7, she is reported to have praised food gifts in the context of a devasattra (for sattra s in the MBh, see Brodbeck 2009: 125–128). In III 221.20, she is mentioned in a list when Śiva and Pārvatī leave Mount Śveta, their entourage comprises a host of gods and goddesses. Pārvatī in particular is followed by Gaurī, Vidyā, Gāndhārī, Keśinī, Mitrasāhvayā, and Sāvitrī. For XIII 134.3, see above p. 218. Interestingly, in XII 256.21, sāvitrī  is an epithet of Śraddhā, who in this verse is called a daughter of the sun: śraddhā vai sāttvikī devī sūryasya duhitā / sāvitrī prasavitrī ca jīvaviśvāsinī</p>
<p>tathā //; for another translation of this passage, see Deussen &amp; Strauss 1906: 434.</p>
<p>956 Cf. n. 952 on p. 218 above.</p>
<p>957 See, for instance, Brockington 2006: 36 and Kane II(1): 523. One may distinguish two types of svayaṃvara s: (1) the rather rare “ceremonial” one, which is associated above</p>
<p>222 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas</p>
<p>pativratā, a wife devoted to her husband (and his family) as opposed to a putrikā, a “female son,” whose own son would continue the lineage of her father (and not of her father-in-law). If his interpretation is correct, the intention to deploy Sāvitrī as a putrikā  would be yet another reproachable – or at least problematic –</p>
<p>act besides the svayaṃvara, for which ultimately Aśvapati is accountable too.⁹⁵⁸</p>
<p>Both misdeeds might indeed be connected. Drawing a parallel with the story of another famous epic heroine, Draupadī, Brodbeck observed that Sāvitrī and Draupadī both have svayaṃvara s, but in each case the choice of husband is later overlaid and overshadowed by the choice of which line will survive, the line of the husband or the line of the father. In Sāvitrī’s case both choices are her own; in Draupadī’s case both choices are made for her. This pattern throws up the possibility of a link between the svayaṃvara  and the putrikā  option, particularly as the putrikā  is in many ways the incestuous wife of her own father.⁹⁵⁹</p>
<p>As we saw, the association of the princess Sāvitrī with a somewhat problematic father is not directly inherited from her divine eponym. Neither Savitṛ</p>
<p>nor Prajāpati have an incestuous relationship with Sāvitrī. The fact that she chooses her husband herself, however, was – if my interpretation is correct –</p>
<p>well established. The Sāvitrī story may also be understood against this historical background. Instead of glorifying self-choice, the story implies that it was a consequence of Sāvitrī’s being a potential putrikā – a girl who was difficult to</p>
<p>“market,” because she would not produce sons for the husband’s own patriline.</p>
<p>Leaving aside further genealogical contemplations, we shall now return to the aspect that is most significant for this study. Clearly, Aśvapati’s plan only became necessary because he was the father of an only daughter. This circumstance, in turn, was the result of his religious practice, which above all included the recitation of the sāvitrī  formula. How could this seemingly innocuous practice cause him so much trouble?</p>
<p>→</p>
<p>all with princesses and generally takes the form of a contest between multiple suitors (the winner gets the bride); and (2) the “emergency” svayaṃvara  permitted only if the father fails to find a husband for his daughter. A real choice is only given in the second type; cf. Brockington 2006: 40: “Basically, the earlier epic svayaṃvara  is a celebration of kṣatriya  valour, whereas the later svayaṃvara,  present also in the dharmaśāstras,  is a means devised to ensure that no woman fails to comply with the brāhmanical ordinance to marry and bear children. The main, perhaps the only point that they have in common is that the woman has reached puberty before her svayaṃvara  but this is probably true of marriage in general in the epics.” Making a too strong distinction between the two types may, however, be problematic; see Brodbeck 2013: 533, n. 11.</p>
<p>958 Whether those who opposed the putrikā  possibility would have preferred Aśvapati to simply dispense with his “putrikā  trick” (Brodbeck 2013: 537), for whose execution it may have been necessary to conceal that Sāvitrī was an only daughter, remains open.</p>

<p><strong>4. Sāvitrī and the sāvitrī</strong></p>
<p>At the time when the Sāvitrī story was composed the author certainly thought of no other sāvitrī  than the GM when using the word sāvitrī. (One could argue that as a Kṣatriya, Aśvapati recited another sāvitrī, but I think that rather unlikely.)⁹⁶⁰ The GM had already achieved a certain status by then. Its role in the story, however, is not a major one. In the manuscripts used for the critical edition of the Sāvitrī story in the MBh, it is mentioned only twice,⁹⁶¹ and only at the beginning of the story (277.9 and 24).⁹⁶² In contrast, so to say, to this double (or single)⁹⁶³ mention of the mantra stands the fact that king Aśvapati repeats the mantra a great, great number of times: one hundred thousand times in the course of eighteen years.⁹⁶⁴</p>
<p>Similar practices are first known from the Dharmasūtras, where the number of repetitions of the GM is most often a multiple of ten (i.e., 100, 1,000, etc.).⁹⁶⁵</p>
<p>Originally this recitation was regarded as a practice in itself, for example, as a purificatory practice or prāyaścitta. Only rarely did it accompany libations into the fire, as in the story.⁹⁶⁶ The author, in any case, was evidently not an expert in Vedic ritual: the fact that he lets the goddess Sāvitrī emerge “from the Agnihotra” ( agnihotrāt: most likely this means that she emerged from the fire) suggests that the GM was recited during this ritual. To my knowledge, however, the repetition of this mantra has never been part of the Agnihotra (which consequently was also never intended as worship of the goddess Sāvitrī).⁹⁶⁷ Although it is made up of real components (and seems much more realistic than many other rituals described in the MBh), Aśvapati’s practice appears to be made up in the 960 See above pp. 120–121.</p>
<p>961 With one insignificant exception: the scribe of G4 replaced sāvitrī  in MBh III 280.8 with gāyatrī. Considering that this verse is obviously about the princess Sāvitrī, this replacement can only be a mistake.</p>
<p>962 One could even argue that sāvitryā hutayā  in 24b does not mean “by the one to whom (oblations) had been offered with the sāvitrī [mantra],” but “by [the goddess] Sāvitrī, to whom (oblations) had been offered” (as in PW  VII: 1634), which would reduce the number of the mentions of the mantra to just one. However, the wording is clearly reminiscent of MBh III 277.9ab ( hutvā śatasahasraṃ sa sāvitryā rājasattama), where the mantra is meant; similar expressions ( sāvitryā + a form of hu “to offer”) are frequently used in the Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa texts, but generally not in the context of worshipping the goddess Sāvitrī. Below I will argue in more detail that the recitation of the sāvitrī  does not have to be understood as an intentional worship of the goddess Sāvitrī at all.</p>
<p>963 See n. 962.</p>
<p>964 If taken literally, he only recited the mantra 15.22 times a day.</p>
<p>965 See above pp. 164–165. The number 108 is mentioned, for instance, in VaikhGS VI 10 (tr.</p>
<p>Caland 1929: 161–162).</p>
<p>966 One may note a ritual prescribed in the JaimGS (II 6; tr. Caland 1991: 55–56), the gṛhakarman, in which the GM is recited 1,000 times, accompanying as many offerings of ghee.</p>
<p>967 The GM is recited in the Kauṣītaki Agnihotra, but this does not involve repetition; see above p. 102 (#15).</p>
<p>224 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas</p>
<p>literal sense, that is, it is fictitious. But even if the author was well acquainted with Vedic matters, his lack of seriousness may have been intentional.</p>
<p>As I imagine it, bringing the well-known sāvitrī  mantra and the goddess of the same name together could, at least in part, be meant as a joke – or, at least, as a surprise. On the one hand, we have the embodiment of piety, king Aśvapati, who devotes his time to reciting the most Vedic of mantras, the “emblem of Vedic piety,”⁹⁶⁸ for the most Vedic of life goals: male offspring. On the other, there is Sāvitrī, the role model of the perfect bride, whose self-choice however must have posed a certain problem. These two Sāvitrīs had never been connected before (see Figure 10 below).⁹⁶⁹</p>
<p>While the mantra was already on the way to becoming a deity, it evidently lacked real personhood, and especially a visible, anthropomorphic form. As I have argued, its portrayal as Savitṛ’s partner in the JaimUB was a strategy employed to elucidate the efficacy of the GM.⁹⁷⁰ It would of course be tempting to draw a direct line from this partnership to Sāvitrī’s later partnership with Brahmā, equating Savitṛ and Brahmā on the way. This merger of powerful male deities could then be explained by some sort of contagion with the Prajāpati incest-myths. We cannot rule out that the texts were never interpreted in this way. From the historical perspective, however, I strongly believe that, originally, there were two entities: first, the divinized and personified mantra, and second, the epic, “popular” manifestation of the goddess Sāvitrī.</p>
<p>One reason for assuming this is that there are no traces of Savitṛ’s being the husband of Sāvitrī outside the few strongly interrelated, rather arcane texts discussed above. The more scattered evidence of the other Vedic texts and the MBh, on the other hand, suggests that Savitṛ was simply understood to be Sāvitrī’s father, and nothing more (that is, especially not her lover). The idea of a very attractive bride choosing among a number of suitors may have easily persisted even without textual support (at least this seems to have been possible for hundreds, if not thousands, of years in PIE culture). The idea of a partnership between a mantra and the deity it addresses, on the other hand, was evidently restricted to a certain textual tradition.</p>
<p>But even if the association of the mantra and the goddess had a comical aspect, we still have to answer the question of their exact relationship. A priori one would expect that if a text addressing a certain deity is recited, this will 968 Lubin 2020: 38.</p>
<p>969 Similar observations were made by Sharma (2011: 22), who, however, apparently took the goddess Sāvitrī only to be a manifestation of the GM: “It is true that women in India are given names such as Śruti or Sāvitrī, notwithstanding the irony that they don’t have access to what their names denote. I would like to highlight the possibility here that in the case of Sāvitrī, it may be a deliberate  irony, given the antecedent and subsequent facts about her personal life.” In the following, Sharma argued that Sāvitrī did not at all conform to Vedic or Brahminical ideals.</p>

<p>invoke that deity. However, this is certainly not so in the case of the repetition of the GM, where the invoked deity would be Savitṛ (notwithstanding the fact that the GM actually does not directly address this god by calling upon him with a vocative or the like). It is not even possible to interpret the deity that appears as a consequence of the recitation as an alternative manifestation of Savitṛ: Sāvitrī is decidedly a female deity. Obviously, it was the name of the mantra – which does not even appear in the text of the mantra itself – that was decisive.</p>
<p>Considering that the mantra and the goddess are not at all differentiated, it really seems that they are the same, at least superficially: Aśvapati “offered a hundred thousand times with the sāvitrī” ( hutvā śatasahasraṃ sa) and “when the eighteenth year was full, Sāvitrī showed herself in her own form to the king”</p>

<p>āsa taṃ nṛpam //).⁹⁷¹ Depending on the perspective, one could think of the goddess either as a deity that manifests in, but is essentially independent of, the mantra – a “mantra goddess” – or as the deified form of the mantra itself, now having a visually perceptible, or imagined, form.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to the earlier texts preceding the Sāvitrī story, later texts are much more explicit when depicting the mantra itself as a goddess.⁹⁷²</p>
<p>There is much to suggest that the Sāvitrī story can be placed somewhere in the middle between these two phases. When the text was composed, the mantra and the goddess were most likely still in the process of being associated with each other. How far this association had already progressed into an outright identification remains open – and may not have been the same for all recipients –</p>
<p>but probably they were still felt to be in many ways distinct and independent of each other. This intermediary phase can be called **stage 4 **in the development of the goddess Sāvitrī.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This chapter has devoted much space to a goddess who, for most of her early life, had almost nothing to do with the GM. As we saw, despite her great beauty, this goddess was not fond of being in the spotlight. If one judges her development only on the basis of textual appearances, one can hardly help thinking that she led an existence on the brink of oblivion. She even kept such a low profile that she could silently change her name. Nevertheless, she came to play a vital role in the deification of the GM.</p>
<p>The goddess was introduced in **Section 1 **as Sūryā, a solar divinity that came to be recognized as Savitṛ’s daughter. Despite her apparently descriptive name, she was not identified with the sun; rather, her solar quality above all consisted in radiant beauty. Her mytheme was characterized by three different elements: her role as the archetypical bride; the self-choice of her spouse; and her association with twins, in the Vedic case, the Aśvins. To various degrees, these three elements are even detectable in other IE mythical characters, which makes it likely that they go back to a PIE precursor.</p>
<p>The idea that Sūryā is a sāvitrī, a “daughter of Savitṛ,” is first made explicit in the AV. As we saw in <strong>Section 2</strong>, this idea must have been generally accepted: only in the AitB, Prajāpati is said to be her father, but even in this text, she is called Sāvitrī. The fact that the author of the later KauṣB chose to replace Prajāpati again with Savitṛ shows that this was indeed thought to be the norm.</p>

<p>972 See Chapter 8.</p>
<p>chapteR 7 ∙ identification with sāvitRī ∙ 227</p>
<p>In the TaittB, the word sāvitrī  was also attached to another character, Sītā, who actually appears to be Prajāpati’s daughter. I have argued that Sītā is a variant of Sūryā: she, too, essentially chooses her husband herself (as with Sūryā Sāvitrī, this is Soma). Why she is called Sāvitrī is not clear. It is conceivable that Sāvitrī</p>
<p>could be used as some kind of epithet for brides in general;⁹⁷³ however, this has not yet been demonstrated.</p>
<p>In <strong>Section 3</strong>, I argued that Sūryā’s mytheme persisted: in the MBh there are two mentions of Savitṛ’s daughter, in both places this is in the context of marriage. For reasons unknown, this daughter is here only called Sāvitrī, never Sūryā. The most important appearance of this goddess is clearly the Sāvitrī</p>
<p>story: while she herself only appears briefly, at least two of her characteristics are present in the princess who is named after her: Sāvitrī, Aśvapati’s daughter, is said to be very beautiful, and like her eponym, she chooses her husband herself. These resemblances suggest that the goddess Sāvitrī was indeed Sūryā</p>
<p>Sāvitrī’s successor, or her manifestation in epic literature.</p>
<p>Continuing from observations made by Brodbeck, I suggested a new perspective on the Sāvitrī story, which also affects its role in the deification of the GM. Brodbeck argued that the princess Sāvitrī’s father, Aśvapati, wants (or has) to deploy her as a putrikā, a daughter whose sons would continue his rather than her husband’s lineage. Such a girl, however, is hard to sell on the marriage market. (Brodbeck also suggested that this, and not her beauty, is the real reason why no suitor dared to approach her.) Eventually she is forced to find – which also means to choose – a husband herself, thus continuing one of the goddess’s salient features. On the human level, however, self-choice was evidently deemed problematic by some. Real self-choice was at best considered an emergency solution. In the Sāvitrī story, it may even be an undesired consequence of the fact that she is a potential putrikā, an option that is discouraged by the text.</p>
<p>What does all of this have to do with the GM? The extensive study of Sāvitrī’s prehistory allows us to draw a negative but highly significant conclusion: originally, the goddess Sāvitrī did not have anything to do with the sāvitrī  mantra or its deified form. As mentioned in <strong>Section 4</strong>, there is no evidence that the sāvitrī  mantra was ever used to worship the/a goddess called Sāvitrī, Savitṛ’s daughter. In fact, her association with the mantra in the story might have been so unexpected that it could be understood as a joke: For eighteen years, the king worships the most beautiful goddess, the archetypical bride, who, however, is also known to be rather self-determined in the choice of her husband. When she finally appears, he asks for many sons – but instead is promised a single daughter and is immediately told to accept his fate, without even being given the chance to make an appeal.</p>
<p>973 As was possibly the case with Sūryā; see above p. 212.</p>
<p>228 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas</p>
<p>The fact that this daughter turns out to be a “second Sāvitrī” appears to be no coincidence: Aśvapati simply got what he asked for. Despite the fact that this unwanted boon is ascribed to Brahmā, it rather seems to be of Sāvitrī’s design (who perhaps even granted it with a certain degree of complacency). The way Aśvapati’s practice is described suggests that the author was not interested in ritual accuracy, denoting a lack of seriousness that may have been intentional and part of his humor.</p>
<p>This interpretation may or may not be correct. There is at least one reason against it: the fact that in other, presumably somewhat later, texts, Sāvitrī and the deification of the mantra are plainly identified, without any trace of humor or lack of seriousness. Whether or not the audience, or perhaps only part of the audience, of the Sāvitrī story were giggling when they heard about the mantra appearing as a beautiful goddess remains open.</p>
<p>But irrespective of its interpretation, the Sāvitrī story is the earliest evidence for the deification of the GM (thus testifying to what we may call <strong>stage</strong> **4 **in the development of the goddess Sāvitrī). While the exact date of the composition of the tale remains unknown, a goddess called Sāvitrī only appears in a few other passages of the Great Epic, most of them in the late books XII and XIII, or in the appendices.⁹⁷⁴ Most of the text passages discussed in the previous chapter were composed around or after the beginning of the Common Era. As we saw, these texts both divinize and personify the mantra, at least in terms of a fictional personification. But even if for some recipients this may have evoked the image of an anthropomorphic goddess, the mantra itself remained in the foreground.</p>
<p>In the Sāvitrī story, on the other hand, Sāvitrī is above all a goddess: she has a visible form – an anthropomorphic one, which we may infer from the fact that the princess is said to be like her in splendor or radiance – she has emotions (in the story, joy), she converses with mortals and immortals, and so on. These characteristics, as unspecific as they may be, were all taken over from the nuptial goddess Sāvitrī, Savitṛ’s radiant daughter. While the sāvitrī  mantra does mention bhárgas, “splendor,” there is no indication that the text of the mantra played any role at all.</p>
<p>But could this single story, which is mainly concerned with telling the story of the princess Sāvitrī, initialize a totally new way of thinking about the GM? Was the Sāvitrī story the source of the mantric goddess, or does it reflect a then emerging or current, real religious imagination or practice? Was the author a bigger joker than his audience, or was he pretty unimaginative? The answers to these questions will probably remain in the dark. But regardless of the author’s humor or piety – or his lack of these qualities – the crucial observation, in the context of the present study, is that the GM is not actually deified itself 974 See n. 955 on p. 220 above.</p>

<p>here, but is identified with an existing, in a way even ancient, goddess. This goddess added what the deification of the mantra had been missing thus far: an appealing anthropomorphic form and, perhaps even more importantly, agency.</p>
