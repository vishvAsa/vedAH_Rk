title = "8 The Mantra Goddess"

+++

**Introduction**

In the previous two chapters I have attempted to show how the Gāyatrī-Mantra became a goddess. In doing so, I adopted a diachronic perspective, focusing on the developments that took place between one stage and the next. This approach shed light on the processes involved in the mantra’s deification. The result of these processes, however – the deity itself – has so far been largely left aside. 

This lacuna will be partially closed in the present chapter, whose primary aim is to outline a portrait of the mantra goddess as she appears in the Sanskrit literature that was composed in the period of Classical Hinduism \(c. 350–550 ce\) and in the first centuries of the “Tantric Age” \(sixth century ce\+\).⁹⁷⁵ To round off the portrait, I will also address conceptions of the goddess that likely originated in the final third of the first millennium ce \(and continued to be elaborated throughout the second\). 

As Hinduism evolved, the GM largely retained its status as well as the qualities, functions, and powers it became associated with in the centuries around the turn of the millennium. It continued to be seen as the first and foremost Vedic verse, as the epitome of the Vedas, and as a hallmark of Brahminical, Veda-centered, culture and orthopraxy.⁹⁷⁶ The only major innovation was the establishment of the designation “Gāyatrī” as another name, or cognomen, of the mantra.⁹⁷⁷

The preceding chapters have shown that the deification of the mantra was not yet fully established when it acquired these qualities, a process that had reached a plateau by the end of the third century ce. However, this chapter will demonstrate that, during the course of the first millennium ce, the qualities of the mantra “rubbed of” more and more on to the goddess, and were gradually integrated into her personality. Thus, the goddess was above all worshipped 975 The Tantric Age was marked by the rise and spread of new initiatory traditions and the concomitant production of novel religious texts \(often, but by no means always called Tantras\). Due to the predominance of Śaivism, Sanderson \(2009\) calls it the “Śaiva Age.”

in the Sandhyā, the first ritual of the day, which from the fourth century ce at the latest was also performed by adult twice-born.⁹⁷⁸ The mantra’s status as the epitome of the Vedas is reflected in the concept of the “Mother of the Vedas,” which, as we shall see, is anchored in the mantra. Apart from these developments, the mantra goddess also became associated, and even identified, with Sarasvatī, the goddess of knowledge and learning. Contrary to what one might assume, this famous goddess did not eclipse the deification of the mantra. 

In fact, Sarasvatī was at times even considered a manifestation of the mantra goddess, and not the other way round. 

The relevant primary sources from the time-range defined above are numerous, and are not easily accessed. In many cases, only one or two editions are available; few of them are critical editions \(the lack of digitized texts, too, hampers extensive research\). For these reasons, I have opted to make a selection of sources. In doing so, I have not only paid attention to ritual manuals and religious works \(in the strict sense\), but also to narrative literature. 

First, I have focused on the late portions \(fourth century ce\+\) of the MBh,⁹⁷⁹ including the Harivaṃśa \(Har.\). The VaiṣṇDhŚ \(which is appended to the MBh\), the Viṣṇudharmāḥ \(ViṣṇDh\),⁹⁸⁰ and the Śiva-Dharmaśāstra \(ŚivDhŚ; sixth–seventh century ce\)⁹⁸¹ have been taken into account as well.⁹⁸² I have also utilized one work of fiction, bhaṭṭa’s Harṣacarita \(Harṣ.; seventh century ce\), where Sarasvatī and Sāvitrī act as two exiled hermit girls. Moreover, I have also considered one comparatively older medical work, the Caraka-Saṃhitā \(CarS; c. 150–150 bce/ce\),⁹⁸³ where the sāvitrī  is mentioned. 

The most detailed information regarding the worship of the goddess is found in the so-called “Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa texts,” a classification introduced by Shingo Einoo for a group of texts whose titles often \(though not always\) end 978 See above p. 150. Interestingly, the goddess does not seem to have gained much significance in the Upanayana; see, however, n. 985 on p. 233 below. 

979 The historical development of the MBh continues to be the subject of debate. For Fitzgerald \(2018\), “the inventive energy of the Itihāsapurāṇa genre seems to have moved beyond the Sanskrit Mahābhārata  tradition into that of the Harivaṃśa  and early Purāṇas” 

between the mid-second to mid-fourth centuries ce. 

980 The upper limit of this text, which can only be estimated on the basis of dated Nepalese manuscripts, is the eleventh century ce \(Grünendahl 1984: 72–73\). There can be little doubt that it is several centuries older. 

981 Mirnig 2019: 471–472, n. 4. 

982 Interestingly, as far as I can see, the other, “orthodox” early Dharmaśāstras \(YājñSm, NārSm, ViṣṇSm, and ParSm; fourth–eighth centuries ce \[Olivelle 2018a: 26–28\]\) do not show any trace of the deification of the GM. 

983 The last major redaction of the CarS took place in the fifth century ce; for references, see Angermeier 2020: 5–7.

with “-gṛhyapariśiṣṭa” or “-gṛhyaśeṣasūtra.”⁹⁸⁴ As supplements or addenda \( pariśiṣṭa, śeṣa\) to the Vedic corpus, these texts are generally affiliated with one of the Vedic schools. However, their purpose is most often to codify new, originally non-Vedic, ritual practices, which may also include Tantric elements. The Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa texts treated in this chapter are the late Jaiminīya-Gṛhyasūtra \(JaimGS\), AVPar XLI, the Baudhāyana-Gṛhyaśeṣasūtra \(BaudhGŚS\), and the Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra-Pariśiṣṭabhāga \(ĀśvGSPar\).⁹⁸⁵ The late recensions of the MNārU, too, belong to the same \(or a later\) period. 

Among the Purāṇas \(which often also contain material that originated after the tenth century ce\), I have considered passages from the Skanda-Purāṇa \(SkandP\),⁹⁸⁶ the Matsya-Purāṇa \(MatsyP\), the Mārkaṇḍeya-Purāṇa \(MārkP\), the Garuḍa-Purāṇa \(GarP\), and the Kūrma-Purāṇa \(KūrmP\). I have also paid pe-ripheral attention to various early Tantric texts; however, for understandable reasons, these rarely deal with the normal, Vedic GM, let alone with its deification. 

The general idea in this chapter is to present comprehensive profiles of what I have identified as the three primary conceptions of the goddess. Each of these is treated in a separate section:

• **Section 1 **\(pp. 234–240\) is dedicated to the concept of the Mother of the Vedas. Here, I will focus above all on epic literature, where the vedamātṛ  makes her first appearances. 

• In **Section 2 **\(pp. 241–246\), I will discuss how the mantra goddess came into the vicinity of Sarasvatī, and explore the various ways in which the two deities became entangled with one another. These range from deep friendship to outright mutual identification. 

984 It is generally assumed that these texts were produced after the latest Gṛhyasūtras \(c. 400

ce\). Einoo \(2005a: 13\) hypothesized that “the texts belonging to the Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa level, with the exception of the Āśvalāyanīya Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa, were composed at latest before the Bṛhatsaṃhitā  namely, the end of the fifth century ad.” However, there are certainly exceptions to this rule. AVPar XLI, for instance, has been placed in the second half of the first millennium ce \(Bisschop & Griffiths 2003: 324\). 

985 A number of other Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa texts do seem to recognize her as a goddess, but do not spend many words over her. The VaikhGS contains a list of numerous entities receiving oblations; Sāvitrī here follows directly after Brahmā \(VaikhGS II 12: brahmaṇe sāvitryai \[tr. Caland 1929: 56\]\). The same Sūtra also mentions an “ocean-like Sāvitrī” \(VaikhGS

III 16: samudravatī sāvitrī \[tr. Caland 1929: 56\]\), whose identity is unclear. Lastly, it also \(once\) prescribes honoring Sāvitrī with the recitation of TaittS II 4.3.1–2 \( ójo ’si…; see n. 790 on p. 185 above\) before the sāvitrī  is taught to the student in the context of initiation \(VaikhGS II 6 \[Caland 1929: 48–49\]\). In the Karmapradīpa \(Karm. I 1.11\), Sāvitrī is counted among the ten so-called “world-mothers” \( lokamātaraḥ\). I have not found material relevant for the goddess in the ṚVidh, SāmB, GPar, or PārGSPar.

• **Section 3 **\(pp. 246–259\) turns finally to the various goddess conceptions that developed in the context of the Sandhyā. As it turned out, this ritual \(and not the Upanayana\) became the most important “home” of the goddess. 

**1. The Mother of the Vedas**

**1.1 A mother goddess? **

The “Mother of the Vedas”⁹⁸⁷ is an epithet and alternative name that is used quite frequently for the GM as well as for its deification. Among the earliest texts to use the expression is the **MBh**,⁹⁸⁸ where it occurs \(at least\) five times, mostly in the later books as well as in the appendices.⁹⁸⁹ The Śāntiparvan in particular contains a number of passages where the Mother of the Vedas comes to the fore. 

In two of them, she appears to humans in a visible form. The two passages are translated below and will serve as a starting point for further exploration. 

In the first passage, Bhīṣma tells a story that leads to a debate between king Ikṣvāku, a Brahmin named Kauśika, Time, Death, and Yama.⁹⁹⁰ In the story, the pious Brahmin practises austerities at the foot of the Himālaya, continuously reciting a certain text. Then, after a thousand years, 

the goddess appeared before his eyes and said: “I am pleased.” Silently repeating the soft recitation \( japya\),⁹⁹¹ he said nothing to her. /7/ Then, out of compassion for him, the goddess was pleased. The **Mother of the** **Vedas **then lauded that soft recitation of his. /8/

Having completed the soft recitation, he whose very being is Dharma stood up, fell with his head to the feet of the goddess, and said this: /9/

987 vedamātṛ  or occasionally vedānāṃ mātṛ; SkandP 8.16–17 has vedabhāvinī; KūrmP II 14.56 has vedajananī. The expression is only rarely used alone; e.g., in ParSm II 5.1cd: ātmakṛcchraṃ tataḥ kṛtvā japed vai vedamātaram. 

988 The expression occurs already once in the TaittB \(II 8.8.m\), where it characterizes Vāc:

“The Speech is the imperishable one, the first offspring of the Sacred Order, the Mother of the Vedas, the navel \(i.e., the origin\) of immortality. Being pleased let her come to our sacrifice. Let the helping goddess be easily invoked by me.” vā́g akṣaram prathamajā́

ṛtasya, védānāṃ mātā́ ’mṛ́tasya nā́bhiḥ, sā́ no juṣāṇó ’pa ⁺ yajñám ā́gat, ávantī devī́ suhávā

me astu. ; tr. Dumont 1969: 62. 

989 As far as I can see, the vedamātṛ  occurs nowhere in the Rām. 

990 MBh XII 192–193. For this story and its context, see Brockington 2012 \(the story is addressed on pp. 82–83\). 

991 Literally, japya  is “that which should be” or “can be recited softly.” 

chapteR 8 ∙ the mantRa goddess ∙ 235

“Fortunately, O goddess, you are kind and have shown yourself to me. If you are gracious, my mind shall enjoy the soft recitation\!” /10/

Sāvitrī said: “What do you desire, best of the Ṛṣis, and what wish shall I fulfill for you? Speak, best of those who recite softly – all of it will become yours\!” /11/

Bhīṣma said: Thus spoken to by the goddess, the Brahmin, a knower of Dharma, said:

“This desire of mine for the soft recitation shall increase again and again, /12/ and the concentration of my mind may increase day by day, O

beautiful one.” 

“So be it,” the goddess then sweetly replied. /13/ And the goddess also said this, desiring to show him kindness: “Not to hell, but where the greatest among the twice-born have gone will you go: /14/ you will go the cause-less, irreproachable place of brahman. I will bring it about and it shall be, that which you have requested here from me. /15/ Being restrained and focused, recite\! Dharma will approach you, and Time, Death, and Yama will also come to you, and there will be a debate here between you and them based on Dharma.” /16/

Having spoken thus, the Lady went to her own abode, and then the Brahmin sat reciting softly for a celestial century. /17/⁹⁹²

As in the Sāvitrī story, Sāvitrī is here invoked by means of \(soft\) mantra recitation. Interestingly, the author of this text for some reason refrained from specifying that which is being softly recited by Kauśika \(his japya\),⁹⁹³ only designating it as saṃhitā \(in verses 6, 78, and 112\). The fact that he causes Sāvitrī

to appear by repeating \( ā\+ vṛt\) his japya  would actually lead one to expect that it is the GM. But considering that this japya  is also called a saṃhitā – a term 992 MBh XII 192.7–17: sa devyā darśitaḥ sākṣāt prītāsmīti tadā kila / japyam āvartayaṃs tūṣṇīṃ

that usually refers to much longer texts – this is not necessarily the case. \(It also again remains open whether the goddess is understood as the deification of the mantra\). The goddess herself, in any case, is not described in any detail; we only learn that she is called Sāvitrī and Mother of the Vedas, and that she is beautiful and gracious.⁹⁹⁴ As in the Sāvitrī story \(and, one might add, as is quite common in Hindu tales in general\), she immediately disappears after her brief appearance, and does not play any further role in the remainder of the story. 

The second MBh story does not explicitly call the goddess “Mother of the Vedas,” but nevertheless deserves to be translated here. As will soon become apparent, the mother motif is indeed present, albeit perhaps in a somewhat unexpected form. The story is found in the appendix to the Śāntiparvan. 

Once, the sage Nārada roamed the earth, visiting sacred and numinous sites \( tīrtha s\). At the foot of the Himālaya, he saw a beautiful girl playing at the bank of a pond. The girl recognized him and sat down near him, smiling and laughing again and again. When she opened her mouth, out came three beings in the shape of men, wearing jewels and ornaments. They circumambulated the girl, making various sounds. Perplexed, Nārada asked the girl who she was. 

The girl said:

“I’m called Sāvitrī, O Brahmin Ṛṣi, listen, happiness to you\! What shall I do? Tell me what is on your mind.” /93/

Nārada said:

“I greet you, Sāvitrī, I’m one who has accomplished his goals, O irreproachable one. Deign to clear this doubt I have, O beautiful goddess: Who is the man-shaped one who came into being first? There are dots on his head, O

great goddess, he has a form made of light.” /97/

The girl said:

“The first-born one came into being first, next was the Yajurveda, the Sāmaveda was the third. Your doubt shall be dispelled, O sage\! The Vedas are furnished with dots, they are endowed with the fruit of the sacrifice. That big light that you have seen – the wise call it ‘the light.’ O Ṛṣi, it can be recognized by\(/through\) me too\!” Having said this, she disappeared. /102/⁹⁹⁵

chapteR 8 ∙ the mantRa goddess ∙ 237

In the story, Sāvitrī is envisioned as a beautiful, divine maiden.⁹⁹⁶ While she is clearly the source of the Vedas, she is not called their mother. In fact, even in the first story, where the goddess is actually called the Mother of the Vedas, one does not necessarily get the impression of a mother of three \(or four\). A father, too, is missing in both cases \(and, as we will see, in all others too\). Could it be that the expression “Mother of the Vedas” was not understood literally? To answer this question, let us have a look at the other epic passages mentioning her. 

In the Udyogaparvan, we find mention of even more than one Mother of the Vedas. At the beginning of a duel between Bhīṣma and Rāma, the former prompts the latter to mount a chariot to fight. Rāma, however, prefers to remain on the ground, replying

my chariot is the earth, O Bhīṣma, the draught-animals are the Vedas, like fine horses; my charioteer is the wind \( mātariśvan\); the armor is the **mothers of the Vedas**, well-covered by them in combat I will fight, scion of Kuru\!⁹⁹⁷

Rāma thus basically proclaims that he will fight without the usual material equipment. But who are the mothers of the Vedas – in the plural? 

Nīlakaṇṭha commented that the mothers are Gāyatrī, Sāvitrī, and Sarasvatī \( vedamātaro gāyatrī-sāvitrī-sarasvatyaḥ\). This triad, however, only really formed several centuries later.⁹⁹⁸ To my knowledge, it occurs nowhere in the constituted texts of the MBh or the Rām. In a note to his translation, van Buitenen asserts that the mothers are the meters, but does not explain why this should be so.⁹⁹⁹ It is clear that, since they are not in the singular or dual, the mothers are at least three. A triad of meters was indeed sometimes associated with the three Vedas in Vedic literature.¹⁰⁰⁰ Interestingly, all manuscripts of the Southern recension except one \(G5\) read devamātaraḥ, “mothers of the gods,” 

instead of vedamātaraḥ \(which is why a wavy line is drawn under the word\).¹⁰⁰¹

It thus remains open which interpretation or reading is correct. 

In addition to the texts translated thus far, a \(single\) Mother of the Vedas briefly appears in two other MBh passages. The first one is a durgāstotra  put into 996 kanyā “girl” \(91 etc.\), anindite “irreproachable one” \(94\), devi “goddess,” śobhane “beautiful one” \(95\), mahādevi “great goddess” \(97\). 

997 MBh V 180.3cd–4: ratho me medinī bhīṣma vāhā vedāḥ sadaśvavat /3/ sūto me mātar-iśvā vai kavacaṃ vedamātaraḥ / susaṃvīto raṇe tābhir yotsye ’haṃ kurunandana /4/; also translated by van Buitenen III: 509. For the description of a divine chariot in which the sāvitrī  and gāyatrī  are part of the equipment, see above p. 74.

1001 In a passage in the appendix of the Har. \(App. I 8.21: sāvitrī cāpi devānāṃ mātā bhūta-gaṇasya ca\), we find a similar alternation between devānāṃ mātā  and vedānāṃ mātā.

the mouth of Arjuna. In the stotra  the goddess is called upon by many names; in one verse she is also called sāvitrī vedamātā.¹⁰⁰² In the second passage, which is from the Nārāyaṇīya, the Lord reveals himself to Nārada in his divine form. 

Among other things that are inside his body, he also mentions a number of female deities: “Śrī, Lakṣmī, Kīrti, and the humped Earth; see the Mother of the Vedas inside me, the goddess Sarasvatī.”¹⁰⁰³ Neither passage gives any more hints with regard to the mother’s motherhood. 

In the **Har. **, the expression is used to qualify the GM, here already called Gāyatrī. The passage narrates how Brahmā created the universe. After the oceans and rivers, we are told that “he then emitted the three-footed Gāyatrī, the Mother of the Vedas, and made the four Vedas originating from the Gāyatrī.”¹⁰⁰⁴ Whether “Gāyatrī” here primarily or even exclusively denotes the GM

or also the meter is not entirely clear. What is clear is that, at least in this verse, the “Mother of the Vedas” really is only a metaphor: the creator of the Vedas is Brahmā, who, we may surmise, somehow used the Gāyatrī to create them. 

The passages dealt with so far reinforce the impression that the Mother of the Vedas never played the role of an actual \(birth-giving, child-rearing\) mother. 

The most straightforward explanation for this is that the expression was, at least in epic literature, only used metaphorically. The basis of this metaphor was the mantra, even when it appeared in its deified form. To understand it, we have to recall the status it had already achieved by about the third century ce. In the MānDhŚ, the GM is portrayed as the essence or epitome of the Vedas, and in ritual practice it frequently functioned as their substitute.¹⁰⁰⁵ In a number of Dharma texts, it was also personified as the mother of the initiate, for whom it was the first Vedic mantra he learned, regardless of which Veda he began to study.¹⁰⁰⁶ Against this background, it is perfectly understandable that the GM

was not only envisioned as having been extracted from the Vedas, but that the Vedas were also thought to have been extracted from the mantra – as, in fact, the Har. passage seems to suggest. 

1002 MBh VI 22.16 App. 1.24: sāvitri vedamātā ca tathā vedānta ucyate //. 

1003 MBh XII 326.52: śriyaṃ lakṣmīṃ ca kīrtiṃ ca pṛthivīṃ ca kakudminīm / vedānāṃ mātaraṃ

1004 Har. App. 41.487–488: tato ’sṛjad vai tripadāṃ gāyatrīṃ vedamātaram / akaroc caiva caturo vedān gāyatrisaṃbhavān //. For the form gāyatri-, see n. 338 on p. 81 above. In another passage, we learn that during the creation, “the best among the meters, the goddess with the twenty-four syllables came into being. Recollecting her together with her feet, the Lord made the divine sāvitrī.” Har. App. I 42.317–318: chandasāṃ pravarā devī

caturviṃśākṣarābhavat / tatpadaṃ saṃsmaran divyāṃ sāvitrīm akarot prabhuḥ //. In the ŚivDhŚ \(III 18: 6.3–4\), Gāyatrī is one of the elements that enter the liṅga  at the end of the aeon and emanate from it again when the world is created anew. Interestingly, it/she is said to enter the very heart of the liṅga \( hṛdaye\), and is characterized as the

“most supreme among all gods” \( gāyatrī sarvadevottamottamā\).

1006 See above pp. 179–182. 

chapteR 8 ∙ the mantRa goddess ∙ 239

The term “mother,” therefore, is used in the sense of “original source” or

“container.” This notion is even reflected in the story about Nārada translated above, where Sāvitrī appears as a girl. Not being a mother, she nevertheless carries the Vedas in herself, and emits them through her mouth. \(Note that this image is in fact quite striking: women were not actually allowed to learn the Vedas, so they would rarely, if ever, have come out of the mouths of women, i.e., be recited by women.\)

At the same time, the mother metaphor blended in well with the increasingly more frequent personification, and indeed deification, of the mantra. In another text appended to the MBh, the **VaiṣṇDhŚ**,¹⁰⁰⁷ for instance, we find the following passage concerning the Sandhyā:

Those who in the morning and in the evening correctly and regularly perform the Juncture \(worship\), pass and lead across \[that is, they attain and bring salvation\] by making a boat consisting of the Veda. If someone **softly** **recites **the purifying **goddess **Gāyatrī, the Mother of the Vedas, he does not sink down while taking possession of the earth and the sea.¹⁰⁰⁸

This passage shows that, at some point, the GM could be simultaneously  conceived of as a mantra and an anthropomorphic goddess. No need was felt to keep these two aspects apart. As we saw in the previous two chapters, this had probably not always been the case: Aśvapati’s recitation of the sāvitrī  in the Sāvitrī story does not necessarily have to be interpreted as an intended worship of the goddess Sāvitrī. Similarly, in the earliest Sandhyā texts that include the invocation of a goddess, the mantra was probably not yet fully identified with its \(deified\) meter. 

**1.2 The Mother of the Vedas and the mother of the meters** The latter texts, in fact, raise another question. What was the relationship between the Mother of the Vedas and the mother of the meters \(or metrical Vedic texts, chandasāṃ mātṛ\) known from various Sandhyā liturgies? As the passages above illustrate, the expression “Mother of the Vedas” was applied both to Gāyatrī and Sāvitrī. To my knowledge, the expression “mother of the meters” first occurs in one of those verses that introduced goddess worship into the Sandhyā, and is only used to characterize a goddess called Gāyatrī.¹⁰⁰⁹ Even though in the 1007 See above p. 76. 

1008 MBh XIV 96.15 App. 4.492–495; see above p. 77. Similar formulations can be found in the Purāṇas: GarP I 36.14ab: saṃdhyākāle tu vinyasya japed vai vedamātaram; KūrmP I 19.56ab: japeyaṃ devadeveśa gāyatrīṃ vedamātaram, II 14.55ab: yo ’dhīte ’hany ahany etāṃ

Sandhyā the GM is to be recited soon after her invocation, it is not entirely clear whether the Gāyatrī is here the deification of the meter, the mantra, or of both. 

Could they be understood to be identical? 

In Chapter 2, I argued that “Gāyatrī” came to be used as a name of the GM probably around the third century ce. While the distinction between the mantra and its meter was often blurred and occasionally even ignored or forgotten,¹⁰¹⁰ the basic meanings of the words sāvitrī  and gāyatrī  were never lost completely. gāyatrī  did not become a perfect synonym for sāvitrī. Nevertheless, in the following centuries, it became increasingly more popular to use the name

“Gāyatrī” for the mantra. 

While the situation may not have been clear-cut at the very beginning, there seems to be little reason to assume that the use of either Gāyatrī or Sāvitrī

reflects the emergence of two discrete goddesses.¹⁰¹¹ That the mantra could possess divine personhood was well established and constantly reaffirmed, for instance, by her invocation in the daily Sandhyā ritual \(or at least certain versions of it\). On the other hand, nothing suggests that in texts such as the MBh, the Har., the VaiṣṇDhŚ, or the Gṛhyapariśiṣṭas that will be discussed below, the goddess going by the name Gāyatrī was understood as independent or distinct from the mantra goddess \(or deified mantra\), let alone as the deification of the gāyatrī meter.¹⁰¹² If the two mother metaphors were ever perceived as semantically distinct at all, then at most this was as different aspects  of one and the same goddess. 

The fact that the gāyatrī  meter was considered the prototypical first meter, however, certainly contributed to the emerging conception of the “mother” 

goddess, just as it had also transferred its qualities to the mantra. As I emphasized in Chapter 2,¹⁰¹³ verses and their meters – or meters and their verses –

are, in practice, not easily separated. Moreover, as parts of the Veda, both meters and mantras were believed to have always existed. The meter thus does not have any “priority” \(in the literal, temporal sense\) over the mantra. Against this background, it is only a matter of perspective whether one says that the primordial source of the Vedas is the gāyatrī  meter, or the most well-known verse set in this meter. The same applies to the goddess, who only rarely shows traces of a dual nature. 

1010 See n. 961 on p. 223 and n. 823 on p. 190 above. 

1011 In MatsyP IV 9–10, for instance, “Sāvitrī” is obviously used as an alternative name of the goddess Gāyatrī. 

1012 In the story of Brahmā’s two wives, connected with his worship at Pushkar \(see above p. 5\), there are no two goddesses – Gāyatrī here is not the meter, but a shepherd girl. Only few Tantric texts seem to treat Gāyatrī and Sāvitrī as discrete deities; see Acharya 2015: xxxiii–xxxiv. 

1013 See above pp. 71–72.

**2. Sarasvatī**

As the previous chapter showed, the deification of the sāvitrī  was aided by its identification with an already existing goddess, the homonymous Sāvitrī, the epic successor of the Vedic Sūryā. Alongside Sāvitrī, there was also another goddess with whom the deified mantra became identified: the famous Sarasvatī. Being the consort \(or daughter\!of Brahmā\) of Brahmā, the creator of the universe – as well as, in particular, of the Vedas – Sarasvatī is well known as the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning, music, and the arts.¹⁰¹⁴ The identification with Sarasvatī constitutes what we may call **stage 5 **in the development of the goddess Sāvitrī.¹⁰¹⁵

Like Sūryā Sāvitrī, Sarasvatī has an ancient prehistory – a prehistory, however, that is much easier to trace back. In Ṛgvedic times, sárasvatī, “the one being rich in ponds,” or perhaps more likely, “rich in floods” and “currents,” was the name of a mighty river flowing through the Northwest of South Asia, now known as Ghaggar or Hakra.¹⁰¹⁶ This river was deified and worshipped as a goddess, and was already strongly associated with “inspiration” \( dhī́\) and “speech” 

\( vā́c\).¹⁰¹⁷ In the course of time, Sarasvatī’s riverine qualities slowly faded into the background, and she became more independent from her “substrate,” the river, which at some point dried up and disappeared. While she continued to be associated with various rivers, she gradually transformed into a goddess of knowledge. In the Brāhmaṇas, she was identified with Vāc, the deification of speech. Vāc, in turn, was also considered a daughter of the creator deity Prajāpati. As discussed above,¹⁰¹⁸ this god was known to have an incestuous relationship with his daughter,¹⁰¹⁹ who is variously identified as Speech \( vā́c\), Dawn \( úṣas\), or Sky \( dív\). With a time lag, this relationship also affected Sarasvatī¹⁰²⁰ –

as well as Sāvitrī \(see Figure 11 below\). 

1014 For an overview, see Söhnen-Thieme 2018; for a more extensive study, see Ludvik 2007. 

1015 For the first four stages, see above pp. 220–226. 

1016 The Ghaggar/Hakra River is an intermittent river whose course runs south of the Sutlej and flows into the Thar Desert \(as it flows only in the monsoon season, it is not shown on the map on p. xvii above\). A summary of the state of research on the Ṛgvedic Sarasvatī can be found in Ludvik 2007: 11–37. According to Witzel \(1984, following an idea of Hillebrandt\), the heavenly pendant of Sarasvatī is the Milky Way. This view, however, is problematic; see Köfner 2008: 6. 

1017 See Ludvik 2007: 32–37, 42, 52–53, and 57–60. Interestingly, this occasionally connects her with Savitṛ. In KhādGS II 4.8 \(tr. Oldenberg, SBE  XXIX: 308\), Savitṛ and Sarasvatī are expected to provide insight. Savitṛ, Sarasvatī, and Anumati are mentioned together in AVP XX 7.1 \(tr. Kubisch 2012: 50\) ≈ AV VII 24.1. In AVP XX 26.5 \(tr. Kubisch 2012: 152\), Savitṛ and a mysterious jagadrātrī \(or × jagaddhātrī\) are mentioned; according to Kubisch, this might  be Sarasvatī.

Prajāpati’s successor in the role of the “Allfather” was Brahmā. While in the MBh, the relationship between him and Sarasvatī was that of father and daughter \(her husband is said to be Manu or the sage Matināra\),¹⁰²¹ in the Purāṇas, they also became consorts. However, Sāvitrī, too, was said to be Brahmā’s wife, possibly even before Sarasvatī.¹⁰²² The idea that Sarasvatī and Sāvitrī could be one and the same goddess simply and apparently suggested itself, and they were indeed identified with each other. One consequence of this merger was that Brahmā once and for all replaced Savitṛ as Sāvitrī’s father.¹⁰²³

**Figure 11: **The identification of Sarasvatī and Sāvitrī

In the transition of the goddess from stage 3 to 5, it is not clear what happened when. In particular, it is unknown how exactly the goddess became Brahmā’s wife. Their union may have been a result of the combination of the various notions and mythemes presented in the previous chapters of this study: 1021 Ludvik 2007: 116. 

1022 Sāvitrī is repeatedly called his wife already in the late strata of the MBh: XIII 151.4b: sāvitrī brahmaṇaḥ satī; 134.57, App. 15.4408a: sāvitrī brahmaṇaḥ patnī; IV 14.19\*297.4: sāvitrīsahitaṃ caiva brahmāṇaṃ paryakīrtayat; 16.7\*347.5: brahmāṇam iva sāvitrī yathā

ṣaṣṭhī guhaṃ yathā. 

1023 Note how this mirrors Prajāpati’s earlier substitution of Savitṛ, whose significance as an individual god had declined even further by the time of the Purāṇas; cf. above p. 208. 

chapteR 8 ∙ the mantRa goddess ∙ 243

the idea of a primordial couple Savitṛ/ sāvitrī; the association of the sāvitrī  with Brahmins, brahmacarya, and the learning of the Vedic texts \(“brahman s”\); or the evolving idea of a “mother” of the Vedas. The idea that Brahmā could or should have a consort \(even if this inevitably meant incest\) was certainly inspired by the various Prajāpati myths, and it could be that Sāvitrī was simply the first goddess so chosen. 

Sāvitrī’s identification with Sarasvatī, in any case, seems to have taken place after the bulk of the MBh had already been composed, that is, within the middle third of the first millennium ce. The following passage from the MatsyP, which possibly belongs to the earliest extant strata of Purāṇic literature \(parts of it were perhaps composed in the sixth and the following centuries ce\),¹⁰²⁴

illustrates the result of this process. The passage is concerned with the creation of the world, a process that also involves the sāvitrī  and its deification: For the purpose of creating the world, having recalled the sāvitrī, he \[i.e., Brahmā\], then after he had recited it softly, having split his spotless body, made half the form of a woman, half having the form of a man.¹⁰²⁵ She is named Śatarūpā \(“having a hundred forms”\) as well as called Sāvitrī, Sarasvatī, further Gāyatrī and Brahmāṇī, O foe-torcher. Therefore he fashioned a daughter who had come out of his own body.¹⁰²⁶

The following verses describe how Brahmā falls in love with his daughter and, against the protest of his sons, marries her. Their incest produces Manu, the first of all men. 

Among other things, the passage shows that the incest mytheme associated with Prajāpati had also become part of Sāvitrī’s “biography.” Sāvitrī no longer simply remained Savitṛ’s daughter and the deification of the sāvitrī  mantra.¹⁰²⁷ Rather, she could become part of a larger, amalgamated divine personage. 

Due to Sarasvatī’s high profile and her connection to knowledge and learning \(which, at least in the case of the study of the Vedas, is inaugurated by a sāvitrī\), this identification proved to be lasting. 

The effects of this identification even proved to be mutual to both. The BaudhGŚS,¹⁰²⁸ for instance, contains a prescription for a so-called sarasvatīkalpa. 

1024 For a brief overview and references, see Ludvik 2007: 117–118. 

1025 The translation emulates the somewhat inelegant style of the original.

1027 Interestingly, in the MatsyP, the mantra already exists before the creation of the goddess and, indeed, the entire world – most likely because she is the epitome of the Vedas, which are, of course, eternal..

244 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas

In this ritual, Sarasvatī is invoked by means of the āyātu  mantra known from the Gāyatrī passage in the MNārU.¹⁰²⁹ After several other mantras and oblations, the goddess is dismissed with a verse beginning with uttame śikhare, which, again, is almost the same as that known from the MNārU.¹⁰³⁰ Sarasvatī

is thus invited and dismissed by mantras dedicated to the Gāyatrī in its deified form. This shows just how far the identification of the mantra goddess and the \(former\) river goddess must have gone, at least in some contexts. 

But the two goddesses were not always conflated. The first chapter of Bāṇabhaṭṭa’s Harṣ. \(seventh century ce\), which is concerned with the divine origins of his own \(the Vātsyāyana\) line,¹⁰³¹ contains an interesting story about Sāvitrī and Sarasvatī. The story recounts how Sarasvatī was once cursed by the choleric sage Durvāsas Ātreya because she was smiling when he made a mistake in singing a sāman. The goddess Sāvitrī, who was nearby, became very angry about this, and reprehended the sage. The vivid passage describing this scene deserves to be given here in full, especially because it contains one of the most verbose \(if quite stereotypical\) descriptions of the goddess, and the four personified Vedas accompanying her:

the goddess was sitting close to the Self-Existent One \[i.e., Brahmā\] in a corporeal form; she wore a bast\(-garment made\) from the Wishing Tree and the Dukūla plant that was yellowish like the foam film of beestings, and had a knot in the girdle \[?\]¹⁰³² bound between her raised breasts into

\[?\] the garment made from the fibers of a \(lotus\) rhizome; the courtyard of her forehead was brightened by the three rows of the ash-mark, banners of triumph, as it were, over the three worlds vanquished by ascetic force; a scarf made from a yoga strap was hanging from her shoulder, white like milk foam, similar to the Ganges stream bent to a circle by ascetic power; in her left hand she held a crystal jar, which resembled the lotus bud from which Brahmā emerged – she threw up the right hand, which was entwined with a rosary and studded with rings made from shells, reprimanding with the waving index finger:

“Wretch\! Prey to anger, malicious, ignorant, ignorant of the self, pseudo-Brahmin, miserable sage, outcast, outlaw – how can you, ashamed by stumbling over yourself, wish to curse Lady Sarasvatī, the mother of the three worlds, worthy to be worshipped by the multitudes of gods, demons \(Asuras \[“anti-gods”\]\), sages, and humans?” 

1029 See above pp. 184–193. 

1030 These verses, which are used in various versions of the Sandhyā, will be discussed below; see below pp. 248–249.

Thus she spoke, and the four embodied Vedas, outraged, left their rattan seats: with their mouths, they made the sound “om” resound; they filled the cardinal directions with the mass of their dreadlocks, which were swaying from being tossed up; they darkened the daylight with the shadows of their bulging black antelope skins, which were whirling around as they tied their belts; they made the world of Brahmā swing with the swaying of their indignant panting; from their foreheads, which gleamed with the pure ashes from the Agnihotra, they exuded the sap of Soma, as it were, under the guise of profuse sweat; wearing lovely chowries of Kuśa fibers, bark garments and canes, they used their round jars as if they were weapons – together with them, Sāvitrī left her grass cushion and stood up.¹⁰³³

However, a curse cannot be undone, and accompanied by her friend Sāvitrī, Sarasvatī was forced go to the forest to live in exile. Soon the two divine maidens met a young man named Dadhīca, with whom Sarasvatī fell in love. Sarasvatī

soon gave birth to a son, Sārasvata, and subsequently returned to Brahmā’s world. For this reason, Sārasvata was raised by a hermit’s daughter who had given birth to a son just at the same time as Sarasvatī. This son, who grew up together with the divine Sārasvata, was called Vatsa, and became the ancestor of the Vātsyāyana line. 

I shall not attempt to explore how exactly one should relate Bāṇa’s depiction of the deities to their actual worship at the time. Nevertheless, a few observations are in order. First, most of the imagery Bāṇa employs in this story is not specific to either Sāvitrī, Sarasvatī, or the personified Vedas. Rather, it is consistent with how forest hermits in general were imagined, with all of their clothing being made from natural substances, Sāvitrī wearing rings made from 1033 Harṣ.

shells, and so on. The antelope skins worn by the Vedas are an archaic Brahminical item. Their depiction could just as well have been applied to human characters. \(Significantly, the two goddesses are also characterized as worshippers of Śiva.\) The goddesses are thus fully anthropomorphic. In fact, neither of them are connected with their prehistory as personification deities. This is especially striking in the case of Sāvitrī, whose origin as a mantra goddess is only briefly alluded to by the word mūrtimatī, “having a corporeal form” or “being embodied,” which possibly suggests that this is not her natural state. 

**3. The Sandhyā goddess**

As said earlier, there are only a few temples these days that are dedicated to the mantra goddess.¹⁰³⁴ This has probably always been the situation. Unlike Sarasvatī, Gāyatrī/Sāvitrī never became a fully independent goddess. Her identification with Savitṛ’s daughter did not change that. Rather, she remained, above all, a deified mantra – a mantra which, it must not be forgotten, was not meant to be recited by everyone. Like its recitation, its worship as a deity was subject to certain restrictions, both in terms of the contexts in which that worship was appropriate and in terms of who was allowed or obliged to perform it. 

In Chapter 5, I argued that one of the most important rituals in which the GM was recited, was the Sandhyā.¹⁰³⁵ At first, the ritual was to be performed daily by the Vedic students. In the first centuries of the Common Era, it also became a part of the routine of initiated householders.¹⁰³⁶ At the same time, the number of repetitions tended to increase in various contexts, including the Sandhyā. The connection between the mantra and this ritual was thus further strengthened.¹⁰³⁷ It is therefore probably no surprise that the Sandhyā also came to play an important role for the deified form of the GM. As a matter of fact, the ritual not only became the first, but also the most regularly performed ritual in which the mantra was worshipped as a goddess. 

In the following pages, I will outline how and into what the goddess and her worship in the Sandhyā developed over the course of the first millennium ce. In doing so, I will also discuss passages that \(strictly speaking\) are only 1034 See above p. 5. 

1035 See especially pp. 146–152. 

1036 See above p. 150. 

1037 AVPar XLI explicitly says that “when the sun has half sunk, when the sun has half risen –

concerned with the mantra; as will be seen, keeping the GM and its deification apart becomes almost impossible at some point. 

**3.1 The early phase**

As Chapter 6 revealed, the earliest evidence of goddess worship in the Sandhyā

is found in the MNārU and the MānGS.¹⁰³⁸ The goddess these texts invoke goes by the name of Gāyatrī, and is clearly a deification, either of the mantra, the meter, or of both. It seems that this deification process started independently of the goddess Sāvitrī, Savitṛ’s daughter. There are, however, at least two passages that also allow for a reading in which this goddess, too, might play a role that is relevant for her development in the Sandhyā. The texts containing these passages are the **CarS **and the **JaimGS**, both of which are probably not too far removed in time from the MNārU and the MānGS.¹⁰³⁹

In the context of a prescription for a payovṛtti  or “milk-diet,” the CarS

once mentions that one should “mentally contemplate/visualize the sāvitrī” 

\( sāvitrīm \+ manasā \+ dhyā\).¹⁰⁴⁰ Similarly, a passage in the JaimGS prescribes that one should “mentally contemplate/visualize the sāvitrī” for the rest of the day if one was asleep when the sun rose or when it set. According to the same passage, during the evening Sandhyā one should contemplate/visualize it mentally until the stars rise, and then recite the sāvitrī.¹⁰⁴¹

These formulations raise questions. Do they entail that one should simply “think about” the Sandhyā \(i.e., the twilight time or the Juncture ritual\) and the sāvitrī,¹⁰⁴² or do they also include “imagining” them \(or at least the sāvitrī\)? 

Could it be that these passages refer to a practice involving the goddess Sāvitrī

as we know her from the Sāvitrī story? Conspicuously, both texts are roughly 1038 See above pp. 184–193. 

1039 For the date of the JaimGS and the MānGS, see n. 465 on p. 112 above. For the date of the MNārU, see above p. 184.

coeval \(speaking in centuries\). Moreover, at least the JaimGS passage is explicitly concerned with the Sandhyā. 

As the CarS and the JaimGS otherwise take no notice of the goddess, no definite conclusion can be drawn. Nevertheless, I would argue that however they were intended, they could easily be understood as such, and in this way at least they might have inspired the imaginations of their recipients. The occurrence of the combination of the expression manasā \+ dhyā  with sāvitrī  in the two texts suggests that it was not restricted to “discipline-specific” discourses. 

It may even have been part of the everyday religious vocabulary. The author of the Sāvitrī story, for instance, might very well have been familiar with it, even though he presumably never studied either of the two texts. 

In any case, the Sandhyā ritual that took shape around the same time and was reflected in texts such as the MNārU and the MānGS, had a much greater and far more lasting impact. This Sandhyā is characterized by special verses that invite and dismiss the goddess. The Gāyatrī passage in the latest recension of the MNārU, translated in full above, contains a total of three such verses, each of which is also found \(with variants\) in other texts:

First, there is a verse inviting the goddess, beginning with āyātu varadā, āyāhi viraje, or āgaccha varade, e.g.:

The wish-fulfilling goddess shall come, the imperishable one equal to the brahman/Brahmā\! 

Gāyatrī is the mother of the meters\(/ metrical Vedic texts\). Find pleasure in this formulation \( brahman\) of ours\!¹⁰⁴³

A complementary verse, beginning with uttame \(or uttare\) śikhare, dismisses her again, e.g.:

O you who are born on the highest peak on earth, on the summit of the mountain –

having taken leave from the Brahmins, go, goddess, as you please\!¹⁰⁴⁴

The vedamātṛ  verse, too, dismisses the goddess. 

Considering their wide distribution, the verses dedicated to the “Sandhyā

goddess” represent one of the most distinctive features of her worship. The information they provide about her as a goddess, however, is limited: First, she is characterized as the mother of the meters or the Vedas. As we saw in Section 1, this characterization is well understood against the background of the development of the mantra.¹⁰⁴⁷ Second, the verses reveal that the goddess was thought to dwell on the “highest peak on earth.” This place may perhaps best be identified as the peak of Mount Meru, the well-known cosmic mountain at the center of the cosmos – a location frequently identified as the abode of the gods.¹⁰⁴⁸ We do not learn what the goddess looks like, who she is related to, etc. 

With the rise of new ritual techniques and modes of worship in the middle third of the first millennium ce, however, more details and aspects were added to her and her worship. As we will see in the following, the mantra goddess became considerably more visual. 

**3.2 A glimpse into the Tantric Age**

In dealing with the Gāyatrī passage, we have already come across one innovation in the worship of the goddess: the embedding of Tantric elements. Here, I will briefly return to the relevant paragraph in the Gāyatrī passage, before I present passages from two other texts that deal with Tantricized versions of the Sandhyā \(AVPar XLI and ĀśvGSPar I 6\). Some parts of these texts or of their contents could turn out to be younger than the tenth century ce in their present form \(and would thus be outside the scope of this work\). Nevertheless, taken together they illustrate very well what kinds of Tantric elements were being in-1045 The brilliance or luster resulting from knowledge of the brahman, i.e., the Vedas. 

1046 For the text of this verse, reconstructed on the basis of the MNārUĀn and the AV; see above pp. 193–197. AVPar XLI 3.2 also mentions it, but only by means of its pratīka. 

1047 See above pp. 238–239. 

1048 For references, see Satinsky 2015; see also generally Mabbett 1983. The vedamātṛ  verse sends her off to the world of Brahmā, which may easily be located atop Mount Meru.

troduced into the worship of the deified GM during the second half of the first millennium ce. 

In the **MNārUĀn**, we encountered the following description, which can be analyzed as consisting of three components:

**\[1a\] **The meter of the Gāyatrī is the gāyatrī, the Ṛṣi is Viśvāmitra, the deity is Savitṛ, **\[2\] **the mouth is Agni, the head is Brahmā, the heart is Viṣṇu, the tuft is Rudra, the womb is the Earth. **\[3\] **The Gāyatrī who, possessing prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna, and samāna, has prāṇa s \(vital forces\), is white-colored, belongs to Sāṅkhyāyana’s gotra, has twenty-four syllables, three feet, six abdominal sections\(/ abdominal sides /bellies\), and five heads. **\[1b\] **The application is in the Upanayana.¹⁰⁴⁹

Stating the meter, the Ṛṣi, and deity of a mantra as well as its ritual application **\[1ab\] **is common practice in the Vedic domain, and was of course also done with the GM.¹⁰⁵⁰ In Tantric contexts, these specifications are even used to

“Vedicize” non-Vedic mantras.¹⁰⁵¹ Here, however, their presence is only natural. 

Inserted between the mention of the deity and the application, we find information that is primarily concerned with the mantra’s deity aspect. The second component **\[2\] **consists of a list that seems to correspond to what is commonly known as aṅgamantra s, a characteristic “accessory” of Tantric mantras. 

The aṅgamantra s are a set of elements associated with a deified mantra. 

They are usually six in number: hṛd\( aya\) “heart,” śiras “head,” śikhā “tuft,” 

varman/ kavaca “armor,” astra “weapon,” and netra\(s\) “eye\(s\).”¹⁰⁵² In the early Tantric texts, however, they were only five, netra  being excluded.¹⁰⁵³ In the MNārUĀn, too, the are only five elements. Moreover, the list deviates from the standard: mukha “mouth,” śiras “head,” hṛdaya “heart,” śikhā “tuft,” yoni “womb.” 

We observe that varman/ kavaca  and astra  are dropped, whereas mukha  and yoni  are given at the beginning and at the end, respectively. A further irregularity is that the GM’s “aṅgamantra s” are not mantras, but gods.¹⁰⁵⁴

Because the date of the MNārUĀn¹⁰⁵⁵ and of this set \(which are not necessarily the same\) is still unknown, it is difficult to interpret this deviation. One may hypothesize that the set of five \(irregular\) aṅgamantra s goes back to a pe-1049 MNārUĀn 35: \[1a\] gāyatriyā gāyatrī chando, viśvāmitra ṛṣiḥ, savitā devata-

1053 TAK  III, s.v. netra. 

1054 Given that aṅgamantra s often follow a certain pattern, however, it would easily be possible to form mantras addressing the gods mentioned; see Padoux 2011: 70–71. 

1055 See above p. 184.

riod in which they had not yet been standardized. Alternatively, they may also belong to a milieu in which they were not even expected to follow the standard: the aṅgamantra s are, after all, a characteristic of Tantric mantras. Furnish-ing the GM with normal aṅgamantra s might have implied that it is a Tantric mantra – and that was certainly not desired. The GM’s “aṅga s” \(which, interestingly, do not include the martial elements of armor and weaponry\) might thus have been devised as Vedic analogues of the much more common Tantric ones.¹⁰⁵⁶

Turning to the third component **\[3\]**, we encounter a curious mixture of mantra and deity elements. Gāyatrī is depicted as a \(super-\)anthropomorphic being, having five vital forces and a white color, that is, a fair complexion. 

Sāṅkhyāyana, to whose gotra  or “clan” she belongs, might be another form of Śāṅkhāyana, a sage to which the ŚāṅkhGS and ŚāṅkhŚS are attributed. Why exactly Gāyatrī is said to be related to him is not clear to me; possibly it has something to do with the fact that this Ṛṣi is associated with the ṚV. 

The following attributes are again concerned with her mantric aspect. That she has twenty-four syllables is \(almost\)¹⁰⁵⁷ self-explanatory. The same goes for her three pāda s \(that these were ever understood in the sense of three human feet is rather doubtful\). Her five heads, in contrast, most likely belong to the deity, not to the mantra \(the six abdominal sections, which are mentioned before them, are addressed below\). The heads are nevertheless symbolic. According to a note in the edition, four of them are the four Vedas, while the fifth is constituted by the Itihāsa-Purāṇas. It seems plausible to associate at least four heads with the Vedas. The number of five heads could have been inspired by Brahmā, who originally had five heads, too \(according to a myth, the fifth was cut off by Śiva\). 

There is, however, certainly more than one set of valid associations. Which one the author of the MNārUĀn had in mind is difficult, and probably impossible, to determine. 

The GM’s six “abdominal sections, abodminal sides,” or “bellies” \( kukṣi\) are quite enigmatic. Do these belong to the mantra or to its deification? The ĀśvGSPar seems to connect the kukṣi s with the mantra’s deity aspect. According to this text, the six kukṣi s are located in the North, East, South, West, as well as in the additional “cardinal” or “axial regions” above and below.¹⁰⁵⁸ However, the passage does not specify what they are. According to a note in the 1056 Another irregular set of aṅgamantra s is found in the so-called “Ucchuṣmakalpa” of AVPar XXXVI. There, they are only four, śiras  and netra  being omitted: the passage 1.12–15

lists hṛdaya, śikhā, kavaca, and astra; see Bisschop & Griffiths 2007: 12–13. Interestingly, other early Tantric texts include both gāyatrī  and sāvitrī  in their list of aṅgamantra s; see Acharya 2015: xxxi–xxxvi and xliii. 

1057 See n. 157 on p. 44 above. 

1058 See below p. 256. Similarly, AVPar XLI 6, which only mentions two \(anatomically normal\) kukṣi s, states that they are “the ten directions” \( daśa diśaḥ kukṣī\); see below p. 254. 

252 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas

edition of the MNārUĀn, the six kukṣi s are the six vedāṅga s \( śikṣā “phonetics,” 

chandas “prosody,” vyākaraṇa “grammar,” nirukta “phonetics,” kalpa “ritual,” 

and jyotiṣa “astrology”\). Neither of these explanations are very convincing, as they do not let us know why there are six kukṣi s in the first place. 

In view of the fact that the specification ṣaṭkukṣi  follows immediately after the syllables and the pāda s, I propose to interpret it as referring to an aspect of the mantra rather than to its deification. Henk W. Bodewitz and Ela Filippone have shown that kukṣi  does not necessarily refer to the “belly” as a whole, but to any of two “abdominal sides” or “sections” – a division of the body that is unusual in anglophone cultures, but seems to be widespread in certain regions of Asia \(both ancient and modern\).¹⁰⁵⁹ Like the two halves of the rib cage, the two kukṣi s essentially form two joint “containers” that are not easily separated. 

In the case of the GM, the kukṣi s could therefore refer to the halves of each pāda \(see Table 21\).¹⁰⁶⁰

**Table 21: **The six-part structure of the GM

pāda s of eight syllables do not have a caesura in their middle. However, inasmuch as their generally iambic cadence \(i.e., the last four syllables\) much more frequently follows a metrical pattern than their opening \(the first four syllables\) does, they do show a bipartite structure. The fact that breaking up the text of the mantra into two symmetrical halves involves cutting through words was not necessarily considered a problem. As a matter of fact, the ĀśvGSPar does just that in order to transform the GM into a set of six mantras to be applied to the body \( nyāsa\).¹⁰⁶¹ While the context is different, this text proves that such a dissection was indeed carried out. 

1059 See Filippone 2020 and Bodewitz 1992. 

1060 Of course, one can also speculate that the kukṣi s refers to the so-called rectus abdominis muscle, which is a paired muscle with each muscle strand usually being divided into three segments \(when visible, this is the commonly referred to “six-pack”\). In this case, the kukṣi s could belong to the deification as well.

Another Tantricized form of the Sandhyā is found in **AVPar XLI**. As part of the quite complex ritual prescribed by this text, the goddess is invited and later dismissed with the āyātu  verse and the vedamātṛ  verse.¹⁰⁶² As usual, the GM is to be recited between these verses. The text also says that one should do so while “concentrating mentally, according to the syllables, on the dedication to the deity and the appearance” \(2.6: yathākṣaraṃ daivataṃ rūpaṃ ca manasi samādhāya\). What is meant by this is explained towards the end of the text. 

We will explain the dedication of the syllables to the deities: The first one \[i.e., the first syllable, tat\] belongs to Fire, the second \[ sa\]

belongs to the Aśvins, the third \[ vi\] belongs to Soma, the fourth \[ tur\] belongs to Viṣṇu; 

to Savitṛ belongs the fifth \[ va\], the sixth \[ re\] belongs to Pūṣan, the seventh

\[ ṇi\] belongs to the Maruts, the eighth \[ yaṃ\] belongs to Bṛhaspati; the ninth \[ bhar\] belongs to Mitra, the tenth \[ go\] belongs to Varuṇa, the eleventh \[ de\] belongs to Indra, the twelfth \[ va\] belongs to All Gods; to the Vasus belongs the thirteenth \[ sya\], the fourteenth \[ dhī\] belongs to the Rudras, the fifteenth \[ ma\] belongs to the Ādityas, to Aditi belongs the sixteenth \[ hi\]; 

to Wind belongs the seventeenth \[ dhi\], to earth belongs the eighteenth

\[ yo\], the nineteenth \[ yo\] belongs to the interspace, to the sky belongs the twentieth \[ naḥ\]; 

four syllables \[ pra, co, da, yāt\] are the deities of the cardinal directions.¹⁰⁶³

This passage, which is concerned with the mantra rather than with its deification, links the individual syllables of the text with certain deities. Examples of interpretations that are in one way or another based on the syllables of a mantra \(e.g., on their number or their phonetic similarity with another word\) are already found in the Vedic literature, where they are in fact quite numerous.¹⁰⁶⁴

But linking each syllable, one after the other, with a specific item becomes most prominent in the Tantric domain, where sounds are generally viewed as parts

of some kind of system \(e.g., the Sanskrit alphabet\).¹⁰⁶⁵ The emphasis on a single mantra and the effort to engage with it from different angles, too, is a Tantric feature.¹⁰⁶⁶

Against this background, it is conspicuous that all of the deities mentioned in the list are known from the Vedic pantheon. In fact, all of them are already listed in almost the same order in one of the most ancient Vedic texts, the MaitrS.¹⁰⁶⁷ Many of them were no longer widely worshipped as individual gods when AVPar XLI was composed. For this reason, their being linked with the syllables is only meaningful when viewed as whole: their collective presence in the ritual invokes a certain Vedic atmosphere, reinforcing the “Vedic potency” 

already associated with the GM. In other words, old wine has been put into new wineskins: the form being Tantric, the content is decidedly Vedic. 

In its last passage, the text turns to the deification of the mantra. Earlier it was announced that, while reciting, one should concentrate mentally and

“according to the syllables on the dedication to the deity and the appearance” 

\(2.6\). Since the information needed to concentrate on the syllables has been provided, we can assume that what comes next relates to the outer appearance of the \(deification of the\) mantra. The text reads:

Her head is the sound om, together with the Vyāhṛtis, her hair is the bunches of grass, her body hair is the herbs and trees, her eyes are the sun and the moon, her laughter is lightning, her breasts are Viṣṇu and Varuṇa, her heart is Rudra, her nipples are the full and the new moon, her flanks are day and night, her two abdominal sections are the ten directions, her stomach is all knowledge-branches, \[including?\] grammar, her buttocks are the earth, her stance is wind, the lunar stations are her decoration. 

Sāvitrī has the appearance of illustrious Sarasvatī, her body is the mantras 1065 This is, for instance, shown by the use of certain code words to designate syllables; see Padoux 2011: 12–14 and Wilke & Moebus 2011: 718–721. An exemplary case is given in Sāhib Kaul’s Śārikā-Stotra, in which the mantra dedicated to the goddess Śārikā is

“hidden”; see Hanneder 2020. Cf. also n. 725 on p. 169 above. 

1066 Cf. Wilke & Moebus 2011: 723. 

1067 MaitrS I 11.10: 171.14–172.8: agnír ékākṣarām údajayad aśvínau dvyàkṣarāṁ víṣṇus tryàkṣarāṁ sómaś cáturakṣarāṁ savitā́ páñcākṣarāṃ pūṣā́ ṣáḍakṣarāṃ marútaḥ saptā́-

In the AVPar, Viṣṇu and Soma have swapped positions; moreover this text omits Prajāpati in position seventeen and instead adds four plus four new items \(beginning with Wind\). Interestingly, the list possibly recognizes the six- kukṣi  structure, in that the second, fourth, and sixth kukṣi s are marked by a different word order. However, we also observe that with the sixteenth syllable \(curiously enough, the MaitrS deviates as well, but at position seventeen\), the word order seems to become somewhat chaotic.

in the pada  and krama,¹⁰⁶⁸ the Brāhmaṇas and ritual texts, in terms of \[?\]

gotra, she is given by Brahmā, given by Brahmā – thus ends the Brāhmaṇa.¹⁰⁶⁹

According to this passage, the goddess appears to be – or rather, appears as –

little less than the entire cosmos. It is doubtful that this means that there was a real cult in which the deification of the GM was \(exclusively\) worshipped as a universal, “pantheistic” godhead. But even if it was only meant as praise, being identified with the cosmos – which also subsumes gods such as Viṣṇu and Rudra – is no small achievement for a mantra goddess. 

The following characterizations, however, are more down-to-earth. The goddess, now called Sāvitrī instead of Gāyatrī,¹⁰⁷⁰ is said to look like Sarasvatī, and to belong to Brahmā’s gotra – both characterizations that are easily understood against the relationships between these deities in this period.¹⁰⁷¹ Nevertheless, the idea of an anthropomorphic deity is, again, not really pursued: rather, Sāvitrī’s body is explicitly said to be constituted by ritual texts of various genres. The apparent “reluctance” to endow the mantra goddess with one concrete body reinforces the impression that she was perceived as a deification rather than an independent goddess in her own right. The ties to her “substrate” 

remained strong. 

When looking at the development of the mantra goddess from her first appearances up to the Tantricized versions of the Sandhyā, we can observe that the number of visual attributes tends to increase. In the ritual texts, which, as we have seen, show a great concern for the formal or structural aspects of the 1068 The words pada  and krama  designate two modes of Vedic recitation in which each word of a mantra is recited separately \( pada\) or bundled together with others \( krama\). The idea in this passage could be that her body is made up of the individual parts of the Vedic mantras \(or just of the GM?\). For a pada  and krama  reading of the GM, see Devasthali 1978: 574.

So how many sounds does the Gāyatrī have, how many pāda s, and what is her gotra, and what is her appearance, what does her body look like?” AVPar XLI 5.1–2: tad yathāgnir devānāṃ brāhmaṇo manuṣyāṇāṃ vasanta ṛtūnām evaṃ gāyatrī chandasām |

256 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas

mantra \(such as its meter\), these attributes generally seem to be more abstract. 

Many of them are in some way linked to the mantra \(its syllables, its ritual functions, etc.\). Instances of “plain anthropomorphization” are only found in narrative texts, where Sāvitrī simply manifests as a divine girl or woman. The Sandhyā goddess’s nature was thus quite complex: First, she was the deification of a mantra \(and a meter\) that has two names. Second, she was strongly associated – and at times even identified – with Sarasvatī. \(Her identification with or as Savitṛ’s daughter, on the other hand, seems to have ceased to play a role at some point, probably because Sāvitrī was “absorbed,” so to speak, by the mantra goddess.\)

Presumably during the last third of the first millennium ce, a system was devised in which the various identities of the goddess were, for the first time, consciously separated. Corresponding to the three different Sandhyās \(morning, noon, and evening\), a triad of goddesses was formed, consisting of Gāyatrī, Sāvitrī, and Sarasvatī. We have already encountered this triad in the Gāyatrī

passage of the Āth recension of the MNārU, where it resulted from the insertion of Sāvitrī and Sarasvatī into the text. Neither the Āth nor the Ān recension tells us much about the relationship between the three goddesses. A much more detailed account, however, is found in the undated \(but potentially late\) **ĀśvGSPar**. Part of the elaborate Sandhyā ritual taught by this text is the “visualization of the deity” \( devatādhyāna\):

\[1\] Precisely the one that is called Juncture is worshipped as the deity of the mantra.¹⁰⁷² One should visualize her as having one form at all times or, according to the junctures, with one form after the other. 

\[2\] If \(one worships her\) in one form, then one should visualize this goddess Gāyatrī as one and the same at the three junctures; having the verses of praise \( ṛc\), the ritual formulae \( yajus\), and the melodies \( sāman\) as her three feet; having six abdominal sections in the North, East, South, West, above and below;¹⁰⁷³ having five heads, Agni as her mouth, Viṣṇu as her heart, Brahmā as her head, Rudra as her tuft; having a staff, a jar, a rosary, and the fearlessness-gesture¹⁰⁷⁴ as marks¹⁰⁷⁵ on her four arms; being bright-colored; wearing bright clothes, unguent, and garland; shining like a thousand autumnal moons; consisting of all gods. 

1072 Cf. MārkP 81.55cd: tvam eva sandhyā sāvitrī tvaṃ devi jananī parā. 

1073 Literally “in the \(four\) horizontal, the upper and the lower directions” or “regions.” 

1074 A gesture whose purpose is to dispel fear: an upright hand with the palm facing the viewer. 

1075 The formulation of the text suggests that the goddesses do not carry these items in their hands, but wear them as marks on their \(upper?\) arms. Painting or even branding divine items as marks became a common religious practice in the medieval period; see also Rastelli forthcoming-a.

\[3\] If, in turn, \(one worships her\) in distinct forms, in the morning one should visualize the deity as a girl \( bālā\), located in the orb of the boy \( bāla\) sun \[i.e., the morning sun\]; red-colored; wearing red clothes, unguent, and garland; having four faces; having a staff, a jar, a rosary, and fearlessness as marks on her four arms; having ascended a goose as her seat; having Brahmā as her deity; uttering the Ṛgveda; presiding over the earth-world; bearing the name Gāyatrī. 

\[4\] At noon, in turn, one should visualize the deity as a young woman \( yuvatī\), located in the orb of the young adult \( yuvan\) sun \[i.e., the noon sun\]; white-colored; wearing white clothes, unguent, and garland; having five faces, with three eyes on each face; having the moon at her crest; having a trident, a sword, a club, and a drum as marks on her four arms; having ascended a bull as her seat; having Rudra as her deity; uttering the Yajurveda; presiding over the interspace-world; bearing the name Sāvitrī. 

\[5\] In the evening, in turn, one should visualize the deity as an old woman \( vṛddhā\), located in the orb of the old \( vṛddha\) sun \[i.e., the evening sun\]; dark-colored; wearing dark clothes, unguent, and garland; having one face; having a conch, a discus, a mace, a lotus, and fearlessness as marks on her four arms; having ascended Garuḍa as her seat; having Viṣṇu as her deity; uttering the Sāmaveda; presiding over the sky-world; bearing the name Sarasvatī.¹⁰⁷⁶

1077 That the uniform goddess is called Gāyatrī is probably due to the fact that, in the context of the Sandhyā, Gāyatrī was indeed the first goddess. This also explains her position as the first of three manifestations. Moreover, as Goudriaan \(1987: 76\) observed, “more often than once \[…\] in Tantric literature the idea is expressed that the young girl represents the Goddess in her purest, essential, unevolved state.”

the atypical mukha  or “mouth”; the “earth”, on the other hand, is missing here\), and so on. The jar and rosary, which we also encountered in the Harṣ., are typical attributes of an ascetic.¹⁰⁷⁸

The characteristics of the three goddesses do not appear to depend on any peculiarities of the goddesses themselves, but on a scheme comprising five sets of three elements. To these belong, on the one hand, age \(girl/ young woman /

old woman\), hue or color \(red/white/ dark/black\), Veda \(ṚV/YV/SV\), as well as

“world” \(earth/interspace/sky\). Each of these three sets follows its own, internal logic.¹⁰⁷⁹ The remaining attributes, on the other hand, are based on the famous trimūrti: not only are the goddess associated, one after the other, with Brahmā, Rudra/Śiva, and Viṣṇu, they also have the corresponding number of heads, bear the characteristic attributes of the male gods as marks on their arms, and ride on their mounts. 

Combining the GM with this kind of practice was evidently problematic for some. Immediately after the above descriptions, the ĀśvGSPar \(I 6\) states that dhyānaṃ necchanty eke: “Some do not accept the visualization.” This was also stated for several other components of the Sandhyā, such as using the GM

for an aṅganyāsa. Clearly, the reason for this is that these are of Tantric origin, and therefore avaidika, non-Vedic.¹⁰⁸⁰ Orthodox adherents of the Vedic tradition would have refused it. On the other hand, not all Tāntrikas would have performed the regular Sandhyā worship either, because many of them considered the Vedic ritual tradition subordinate to their own.¹⁰⁸¹

The middle ground between these two groups, however, was large. It is well known that in texts such as the Purāṇas \(and, indeed, many others\), which became important sources for mainstream Smārta Hinduism, Vedic and Tantric elements were frequently melded. The ritual practices they describe are in many ways “hybrid.” In fact, not even the tradition that harbored the deification of the epitome of the “eternal” Vedas remained static. Tantric elements are even 1078 See also n. 1075 on p. 256 above. 

1079 For various examples of the phases of life or ages of the goddess, see Goudriaan 1987. The colors of the goddesses follow a pattern that is already found in the ŚvetU \(IV 5\). They could also be explained with the help of the three Sandhyās: while the morning Sandhyā

is usually done close to sunrise – and therefore often during the reddish dawn – the evening Sandhyā can last up to the point where the first stars become visible, that is, when it becomes dark; cf. Kane II\(1\): 313. The order of the Vedas is the traditional one; that of the worlds is known from the three Vyāhṛtis. 

1080 Cf. Hanneder 1997: 155: “For this one must keep in mind that the uncompromising Vaidikas, i.e. the Śrautas, as well as the Tāntrikas, were minorities keenly aware of their religious identity and therefore most probably alert to foreign influences.” For the

“Vaidika exclusivity,” see also Sanderson 2015: 159–169. 

1081 “Abhinavagupta’s student Kṣemarāja \(fl. c. 1000–1050\),” for instance, “asserts that one should continue to perform the Vaidika ritual of venerating the Juncture of the day \( brāhmī saṃdhyā\) before one venerates it in the Śaiva manner \( śaivī saṃdhyā\) only so long as one’s mind is in thrall to one’s constructed social identity as a member of a caste.” Sanderson 2015: 176.

found in texts that \(often successfully\) claimed to be part of the Vedic corpus: the various versions of the MNārU, associated with the KYV and the AV; the Atharvavedic AVPar; and the Ṛgvedic ĀśvGSPar. Many of the religious practices codified in such Tantricized Vedic texts have become quite popular.¹⁰⁸²

**Conclusion**

**Section 1 **examined the meaning of the designation “Mother of the Vedas.” As we saw, it was not only applied to the mantra, but also to its deified form. One could expect that this designation was the concomitant of the emergence of a family mythology,¹⁰⁸³ in which the mantra goddess is the mother, Brahmā the father, and the Vedas are their children. But evidently this was never the case. 

Despite the fact that it was applied to a real personification, the personification remained metaphorical. 

The metaphor was based on the role of the mantra as the epitome of the Vedas. In the MānDhŚ and other texts, the GM is characterized as the essence of the Vedas, which in this case are temporally prior to the mantra. However, in the case of eternal entities, such as the Vedas, temporal priority is not a concept that is easily sustained. The idea of the epitome or extract of the Vedas could easily be turned on its head: if the essence of the Vedas is encapsulated in the mantra, the mantra may also be the original source from which they were extracted, their “mother,” as it were. This also makes sense in view of the fact that the GM

is the very first Vedic mantra to be learned. 

The same logic also has to be kept in mind when facing the problem of the two “aspects” of the goddess: the metrical Gāyatrī and the mantric Sāvitrī. As we saw, these were more often conflated than distinguished, and it is generally unwarranted to assume the existence of two individual goddesses \(see Figure 12

below\). The reason for this is not only that both names were used as names of the mantra, but also that neither the meter nor mantra could claim temporal, or ontological, priority: in the emic view, both Vedic meters and Vedic mantras have existed since beginningless time. In practice, the same generally also applied to the corresponding deification\(s\). 

**Section 2 **turned to another salient development: the entanglement of the mantra goddess with Sarasvatī. In the preceding Chapter, I suggested viewing 1082 As Hanneder \(1997: 162\) remarked, the ĀśvGSPar in particular “has made its way into mainstream ritual and was not only quoted by later authors, but also used by Hillebrandt and Kane for their description of details of domestic ritual.” 

1083 Cf. Leeming 2001: 150: “Sāvitrī is the birth-giver of and sometimes, as Gāyatrī, a personification of the Vedas.” 

260 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas

the development of the goddess Sūryā/Sāvitrī in four stages: first, there was Sūryā Sāvitrī, whose father was Savitṛ and whose husband was Soma; second, Prajāpati was introduced as an alternative father; third, the goddess gave up her first name and became Sāvitrī \(Brahmā’s wife and/or Savitṛ’s daughter and/or Tapatī’s sister\); fourth, she was identified with the mantra. Not long after the last stage, the emerging mantra goddess was identified with other goddesses, most importantly, with Sarasvatī. These new identifications inaugurated what we may call **stage 5 **in the development of the goddess Sāvitrī. 

Her conflation with Sarasvatī only seems to have taken place when she had already assumed her role as a mantra goddess, that is, sometime during the middle third of the first millennium ce. Ever since, the two goddesses have been frequently associated with each other. In the Harṣ., Bāṇabhaṭṭa simply depicts them as friends. Inasmuch as they appear as two \(anthropomorphic\) girls in this work, their identities are strictly kept apart. In ritual or religious contexts, on the other hand, this was less often the case: especially in the Sandhyā, Sarasvatī

often simply appears as a manifestation, or different name, of Sāvitrī/Gāyatrī

\(or vice versa\).

**Figure 12: **The Mother of the Vedas and Sandhyā goddess **Section 3 **was dedicated to the mantra goddess as she appears in the Sandhyā. When looking at the history of the goddess in this ritual, we observed that her identities were in a constant flux. Indeed, the Sandhyā verses give the

chapteR 8 ∙ the mantRa goddess ∙ 261

impression that the primary idea was that this ritual should somehow include the worship of a goddess – the “Sandhyā goddess,” as it were – but whether this goddess was understood as the deified gāyatrī  meter, the mantra, or a combination of both, appears to have been secondary. 

The earliest texts indicating the presence of goddess worship in the Sandhyā probably came into being in the centuries around the turn of the millennium. The idea that reciting the sāvitrī  during the Sandhyā might also involve imagining it – or presumably, her – might even be alluded to in the CarS and the JaimGS, but the evidence is highly uncertain. The Sandhyā verses, on the other hand, unequivocally attest to goddess worship in the Juncture ritual. It seems plausible to me that the MNārUDr and the MānGS were composed at a time when goddess worship was not yet an integral part of the Sandhyā, and that subsequent versions tend to become more explicit and elaborate. Both the Upaniṣad and the Sūtra only contain the first Sandhyā verse in which the goddess is called Gāyatrī and is ambiguously described as the mother of the chandas es, the meters or metrical texts. In their terseness, they leave open whether the mantra itself was already conceived of as a goddess. However, the name Sāvitrī

soon found its way into the ritual, and the characterization of the goddess as Mother of the Vedas leaves little doubt that the mantra, too, became included in the deification. 

Her worship in the Sandhyā secured the mantra/meter goddess a permanent place in the daily lives of many devout twice-born. The Sandhyā, which, almost from the beginning, has been a composite ritual comprising various \(and varying\) practices, also became a hub for the introduction of a multitude of new ideas, speculations, and concepts surrounding the goddess. We saw that this even included Tantric elements: In the case of the MNārUĀn, we observed the introduction of atypical “aṅgamantra s,” normally a characteristic accessory of Tantric mantras. In AVPar XLI, each syllable of the text of the mantra is linked with a specific Vedic deity – an emphasis on sound \(rather than form\) that became especially prevalent in Tantric traditions. 

The Tantricization of the Sandhyā can be observed particularly in the increase of visual elements in the description of the deified form of the GM. The earliest texts in which the mantra goddess appears do not provide much information about her outer appearance. In the texts from the Tantric Age, on the other hand, details abound. There appear to be two modes of anthropomorphism occurring side-by-side: on the one hand, there are the mantric attributes: the three pāda s – literally “feet” – the six kukṣi s – “abdominal sections” or, as I have argued, pāda-halves – as well as the aṅga  or limb mantras, which are routinely associated with or identified as deities, Vedas, and so on. Despite their designations, these properly belong to the mantra, or to its “body,” and not to the goddess. On the other hand, the mantra goddess is also given a concrete

262 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas

shape, for instance when she is said to have five heads, a fair complexion, to wear a garland, look like Sarasvatī, etc. Attributes such as these clearly belong to an anthropomorphic goddess. 

Significantly, however, both aspects are frequently intertwined. The paragraph in the MNārUĀn starts with specifications concerning the mantra. It then states that Gāyatrī is alive \( saprāṇā\), has a fair complexion, and belongs to Sāṅkhyāyana’s gotra – and immediately after, that it/she has twenty-four syllables, and so on. A similar description is given in the ĀśvGSPar, especially for her first, uniform manifestation. In these contexts, Sāvitrī/Gāyatrī remained a true personification deity, which is strongly dependent on its substrate. The explanation for this is simple: Unlike the river of the goddess Sarasvatī, for example, the mantra was always readily available. Its worship almost always included its recitation.¹⁰⁸⁴

1084 As Brahmā’s or Satyavat’s wife, the goddess could also be venerated by those who were not allowed to recite the Vedic texts – a group which, significantly, also comprises women; cf. n. 934 on p. 215 above.

**General Conclusion:**

**From Verse to Deity**

During the long time of its existence, the formula technically referred to as ṚV

III 62.10 has played many roles: that of a verse that mentions, and a mantra dedicated to, the god Savitṛ; a manifestation of the gāyatrī  meter; an excellent

“opening” for recitation; an initiation mantra; a means of purification; the Vedic verse par excellence; and the epitome of the Vedas. Furthermore, it also came to be seen as a manifestation of the goddess Sāvitrī; a deification of the mantra and its meter; a Sandhyā goddess; a wife of Brahmā; and a form of Sarasvatī. 

In its two introductory chapters, the present study first dealt with the meaning and the designations of this formula, which has become known as the Gāyatrī-Mantra. The subsequent six chapters showed how the mantra gained prominence as a religious text and how it came to be deified. 

To reconstruct this history, passages from more than one hundred Vedic and Sanskrit texts from about 1000 bce up to 1000 ce were subjected to philological-historical analysis. The classical explanations of the use of Vedic mantras in the Gṛhya and Śrauta rituals were supplemented by a statistical approach that made use of the possibilities offered by the digitized version of the UVC. In addition, recent research on the history of Vedic religion and Early Hinduism was utilized to contextualize and describe the early development of the GM. To explain the process of deification, the study also drew on perspectives and insights from religious studies. This made it possible to trace the process of deification in a conceptually more precise way than a purely historical or philological analysis would have done. 

**Part I **demonstrated that the adaptive reuses of the mantra in the mid-Vedic Śrauta rituals were decisive for its selection as the primary initiation mantra, and further argued that this function was mainly responsible for its subsequent rise to becoming an emblem of Brahminical Hinduism. **Part II **traced the development of the mantra into and as a goddess as far as the Tantric Age. It showed that several factors contributed to its deification, among them not only its personification, but also its identification with the goddess Sūryā, or Sūryā

Sāvitrī. The following pages summarize this study’s results in more detail. 

264 ∙ gāyatRī: mantRa and motheR of the vedas **1. The rise of an inconspicuous verse**

In **Chapter 1 **\(“Meaning”\), we saw that those who first heard Viśvāmitra’s verse must have immediately understood it: in fairly simple language it formulates a wish shared by many poets of the time, namely the wish to obtain “splendor” 

\( bhárgas\). Specifically, this is the splendor of the well-known deity Savitṛ, who \(as the two verses following the GM in the ṚV make clear\) is also expected to inspire the composition of even more verses dedicated to him. Considering the cultural and religious background, it is possible that Savitṛ’s splendor was thought to be some kind of inspiring “light.” However, I argued that Savitṛ’s splendor was probably synonymous with glory and fame. This is indicated first of all by the fact that it is not Savitṛ’s bhárgas, but Savitṛ himself, who is expected to provide inspiration. Second, other Vedic texts always use bhárgas  alongside similar words, such as várcas “luster,” or yáśas “fame.” 

In the course of the further development of Vedic ritual, the verse, like thousands of others, became the content of a fixed mantra. As a consequence, its literal meaning became secondary.¹⁰⁸⁵ Although it was at least partially understood throughout the entire Vedic period, as a mantra its use was virtually always determined by its formal features. This is first of all shown by its reuses in Śrauta ritual. **Chapter 3**¹⁰⁸⁶ \(“Adaptive Reuse in Śrauta Ritual”\) presented an overview of these reuses and analyzed their interrelationships. It showed that the most important features of the mantra were that it mentions the god Savitṛ and is set in the gāyatrī  meter. Thus, its employment was determined by what I have called the “deity principle” and the “metrical principle”:¹⁰⁸⁷ verses mentioning Savitṛ were frequently recited at the beginning of liturgies, because Savitṛ, the “Impeller,” is responsible for setting things in motion in general. The gāyatrī  meter, on the other hand, was considered the “prototypical first,” or

“primordial,” meter, and was associated with the early morning, the beginning of the day. Due to the properties associated with Savitṛ and the gāyatrī  meter, the GM was very well suited to serve as the first or opening verse in various contexts, for example in the Agnyupasthāna litanies and most variations of the Vaiśvadeva-Śastra. 

In Śrauta ritual in general, the GM was simply considered a perfect specimen of a sāvitrī  in the gāyatrī  meter. There were also other frequently cited and reused sāvitrī s, which sometimes even took the place of the GM. Looking at the various reuses from a diachronic perspective, however, a certain development can be discerned. We can distinguish two chronological phases of text produc-1085 For the relationship between mantras and language, see above pp. 11–13 \(Section 2.1\). 

1086 Chapter 2, whose focus is on a later phase in the GM’s history, is summarized below p. 267. 

1087 See above pp. 13–18 \(Section 2.2\), especially pp. 15–16.

tion, which, moreover, also took place in different regions. First, there was an early, western/central phase, associated with texts such as the MaitrS, the TaittS, and the early parts of the AitB. In these texts, the GM is not regarded as having any special importance as an individual mantra. A later, eastern phase can be associated with the ŚatB, the VājS, the KauṣB, and the ŚāṅkhŚS, whose composition and formation were in many ways influenced by Western precursors. 

In this second phase, there are some indications that the GM may already have acquired a certain renown as a special mantra, for instance in the Aśvamedha hymn, where it seems to have inspired the creation of the other gāyatrī sāvitrī s. 

It was also towards the end of the second, late-Vedic phase that the most decisive moment in the history of mantra took place. Around the time of the ŚatB, mantras were sought that would inaugurate the study of the Vedas as the first texts to be imparted. A number of mantras were to fulfil this function, not only the GM, but also other sāvitrī s \(ṚV VII 45.1 and V 81.1; V 82.1 was taught as part of a repeated, additional Upanayana\). In **Chapter 4 **\(“Selection as Initiation Mantra”\), I argued that these mantras did not simply emerge as initiation mantras from the mists of time, but were selected according to certain principles. These principles can be inferred from the common features of the initiation mantras we know of: \(1\) explicit mention of Savitṛ; \(2\) dedication exclusively to Savitṛ; \(3\) appropriate meter; and \(4\) being the first verse in \(5\) a Ṛgvedic hymn dedicated to Savitṛ. Even if one only applies the first, most important principle to the ṚV, it appears that there are not even a hundred sāvitrī s in total. 

If one checks how often the sāvitrī s that were actually used as initiation mantras had been cited or reused in Śrauta texts before they were selected, it turns out that they are among the most frequently mentioned sāvitrī s. This textual frequency reflects the circumstance that they were often recited in various rituals across schools. I suggested that the wide distribution of these verses was the consequence of a positive feedback loop of reciting and listening, whose effects on individual mantras I described as a kind of “snowball effect”: Whenever a mantra is recited, it also leaves a certain impression in the mind of its reciter and of those listening \(for example, the other priests in a Śrauta ritual\). Every recitation serves to increase its familiarity and prominence, and like a rolling snowball picking up even more snow and momentum the larger it becomes, a single mantra becomes better known the more often it is recited and heard. 

The “snowball effect” also has an influence on how often a mantra is reused. In the emergence of rituals \(strictly religious or otherwise\), creativity and conscious design often play at least as important a role as the codification of habitualized acts. Moreover, we observe that rituals are frequently modified and adapted to new circumstances. In the case of Vedic rituals, it was Brahmins who were primarily responsible for this. In particular, there are clear indications that Gṛhya rituals \(including the Upanayana\) were at some point

266 ∙ gāyatRī: mantRa and motheR of the vedas revised by Brahmin experts who were proficient in the Śrauta texts and rituals. 

When looking for suitable mantras for a new ritual, or a ritual that was to be modified, these experts primarily resorted to collections of mantras that were already used in Śrauta ritual. It stands to reason that in doing so, they would tend to reuse mantras that were well known to them. As I argued in Chapter 4, at least in the case of the sāvitrī s that came to be used as initiation mantras, this indeed seems to have been the case: all of them were already being reused in a range of rituals before they were selected for the Upanayana. 

The earliest text to mention the use of the GM as an initiation mantra is the ŚatB. It does so in order to present it as the better alternative to a sāvitrī  in the anuṣṭubh  meter. This suggests that already in the late-Vedic period, sāvitrī s in other meters were used as well, possibly even in the standard version of the Upanayana. It is nevertheless plausible that the GM had early established itself as the primary initiation mantra, above all because the gāyatrī  meter was associated with the Brahmins \(the triṣṭubh  and the jagatī  were associated with Kṣatriyas and Vaiśvyas, respectively\). An important side effect of this development was that the word sāvitrī  came to be used as a name of the GM: by the time of the early Gṛhyasūtras, it was in most cases no longer necessary to specify which sāvitrī  was meant, but rather to indicate if it was a sāvitrī  other than ṚV III 62.10. This individuation represents a significant step in the career of the mantra.¹⁰⁸⁸

In the following centuries, the GM became strongly associated with specific functions that were in many ways prefigured by its employment in Śrauta ritual. As it became the mantra that could make a person a full member of the ārya  society, it also became important outside the liturgical and ritual domains. 

In **Chapter 5 **\(“Status in Early Hinduism”\), I argued that in Early Hinduism, the status ascribed to the GM as well as its use in ritual practice continuously influenced each other. Thus, the GM was not only the first mantra to be taught in the initiation ritual, but also the key mantra in the first \(and last\) ritual of the day, the Sandhyā. In this ritual, its recitation above all served as a purificatory practice or prāyaścitta, whose purpose is to uphold or restore the pure status of the twice-born reciter. As the mantra that makes a person a twice-born in the first place, the GM was perfectly suited for this function. As a matter of fact, repetitive recitation of the GM features prominently among the many kinds of prāyaścitta s described in the Dharmasūtras. 

The position of the GM in the Upanayana and the Sandhyā led to it being considered not only the typical first but also the “foremost” or most important Vedic verse. Several Gṛhyasūtras contain lists of divinities worthy of receiving oblations. In these lists, the GM is the only verse present, and usually precedes the Vedas. This shows that it was not only considered the Vedic verse par excel-1088 Cf. above pp. 18–20 \(Section 2.3\). 

geneRal conclusion: fRom veRse to deity ∙ 267

lence,  but even placed on a par with the Vedas. It even came to be regarded as an epitome of the Vedas. This role became manifest on two levels. On the practical level, it was in some cases possible to substitute recitation of \(parts of\) the Vedas with the recitation of the GM. On the “theological” level, the three pāda s of the verse were interpreted as an extract from the three Vedas. Similar to the syllable om – and often even together with it as well as with the Vyāhṛtis – the GM came to be considered “le Veda essentiel,” the “essential Veda,” as Malamoud \(1977\) put it. 

One of the driving forces behind this development was the extension of the initiation ritual. In the beginning, only those Brahmins who engaged in the arduous study of Vedic texts underwent the Upanayana. At some point, however, the Upanayana became a rite of passage that was declared obligatory for non-Brahmin ārya s as well. The corollary of this extension was that in practice, almost every initiate learned the GM in order to become a full-fledged member of the ārya  society. For a great number of twice-born, the GM was the only Vedic mantra they learned, and was therefore perceived as their most important element. This may have set in motion yet another feedback loop: we can imagine that when non-specialists began to view the GM as the essence of the Vedas, Brahmins trained in the Vedas, too, became more inclined to regard and also proclaim it as such. 

The significance of the GM in Brahminical, or Veda-centered, Hinduism also inspired the creation of similar mantras in other traditions. These strongly modified versions of the GM were not dedicated to Savitṛ, but to the central deity \(or deities\) of the tradition that produced them. In **Chapter 2 **\(“Designations”\), I argued that the modified GMs were responsible for the revival of, or renewed the attention to, a category that had, by that time, become obsolete: the category of gāyatrī  verses. As the Vedic GM was naturally considered the original and most important one, it became possible to simply refer to it as gāyatrī  without further specifications \(nevertheless, occasionally sāvitrī gāyatrī  or gāyatrī sāvitrī  were used as well\). The substitution of the name sāvitrī  with gāyatrī \(or their combination\) can best be explained by the fact that the entire category had regained significance. Since the modified GMs can be dated to the second century ce at the very earliest, “Gāyatrī” must have established itself as another name of ṚV III 62.10 only after this time, probably around the third century ce. Since then, both class names have been used equally as names of the mantra, while never fully shedding their original meanings. 

268 ∙ gāyatRī: mantRa and motheR of the vedas **2. The deification of a well-known mantra**

The second part of this study traced the development of the mantra into and as a goddess up to the Tantric Age. In the Introduction, I suggested that we understand the process of deification as an entangled interplay of intra- and interpersonal creation, appropriation, and modification of information and ideas.¹⁰⁸⁹

When studying deification from a historical perspective, we can only observe the surface of this process by identifying its results in the extant sources. Only in some cases is it possible to make inferences about the actual flow and transformation of ideas. In the particular case of the sources relevant to the deification of the GM, this can be done comparatively well: as many of them were reworked or updated several times over the centuries, we are in a position to infer how the redactors might have understood the original versions. Moreover, the textual sources are fairly numerous, thus offering us insights into conceptions concerning the \(deified\) GM prevalent in a certain period. 

There certainly was more than enough “backing material” for the development of the notion of a mantra goddess.¹⁰⁹⁰ **Chapter 6 **\(“Personification, Divinization, Deification”\) showed that the earliest passages attributing the qualities of divinity and personhood – defined here as the key features of deities¹⁰⁹¹ –

to the GM are found in a small number of chronologically late passages in several Vedic texts: the JaimUB, the GopB, the MNārU, and the AV. Each of these passages exists in several versions that reflect historical developments. 

In the JaimUB, the mantra appears as the partner or spouse of the Vedic god Savitṛ. The text exemplifies a well-known aspect of the Vedic religion: everything that has a name can be personified. While the numerous personifications in the Vedic texts were certainly given religious importance, their existence does not imply that they also had a cult.¹⁰⁹² Even though the GM in the JaimUB

is a divinity of sorts, the motive behind the creation of the passage was not to provide the basis for or promote the worship of its deified form but to explain the efficacy of the mantra. 

In the GopB, the personification of the mantra was further developed. In this text as well as in several Dharma texts, the mantra is mentioned as the 1089 See above pp. 28–30 \(Section 3.3\). 

1090 In the Introduction \(see n. 49 on p. 12 above\), I mentioned that emic traditions consider mantras a form of speech or language \( vāc\), which, as many other concepts and abstractions, has been considered a deity since the ṚV. In the TaittB, Vāc is even once called “Mother of the Vedas” \(see n. 988 on p. 234 above\). As goddesses however, Vāc and Sāvitrī only came closer to one another via Sarasvatī \(above p. 241\), and I have not found that she contributed much to the deification of the GM specifically. 

1091 See above pp. 30–34 \(Section 3.4\). 

1092 Indeed, I would even venture the hypothesis that there were recipients of the texts who would have understood them as purely metaphorical devices, even though the specific concept of metaphor was alien to them.

mother of the initiate, that is, of the brahmacārin  who has undergone the Upanayana. One might assume that this concept was particularly formative, especially considering that those who were confronted with it were generally young boys who had just been separated from their mothers. It seems plausible that many dvija s would at least remember it for the rest of their lives. Nevertheless, the personification of the GM in the Upanayana does not seem to have led to the development of a mother goddess – at least not of a goddess who would be the second mother of the twice-born. 

The MNārU, which exists in \(at least\) three different versions, contains a passage that is dedicated to a goddess worshipped in the Sandhyā. In its earliest recension, a goddess called Gāyatrī is invoked. A parallel passage in the MānGS suggests that this goddess was originally \(and above all\) the deification of the gāyatrī  meter. Inasmuch as the GM might have been easily understood as a manifestation of the deified gāyatrī  meter, however, its deification was probably already prefigured in these Sandhyā liturgies. Her characterization as chandasāṃ mātṛ, “mother of the meters” or “metrical Vedic texts,” was, just like the name Gāyatrī itself, also applicable to the deification of the mantra.¹⁰⁹³ Since the invocation of the goddess always included the recitation of the GM, the step from gāyatrī  to Gāyatrī was not a big one. 

The two later recensions of the MNārU also invoke the goddess\(es\) Sāvitrī

and Sarasvatī, which to me suggests that the redactors \(and users\) of these passages understood the original passage to be about the mantra goddess. Moreover, they also composed and included what I have called the vedamātṛ  verse. 

The purpose of this verse is to dismiss the chandasāṃ mātṛ  who is invoked at the beginning of the liturgy. The wording of this verse, which even became part of the AV, leaves no doubt that the goddess worshipped in the Sandhyā was the deification of the GM. The latest version of the MNārU even contains a description of her anthropomorphic manifestation. 

I assume that the textual developments in the JaimUB, GopB, MNārU, and AV reflect different stages of a protracted process of deification. The authors and redactors of these texts \(and the creators and modifiers of the rituals for which they were used\) belonged to various regions and times, and to various Vedic schools. Since the texts were handed down and also modified over a long period of time, generations of people were involved in their transmission. The number of people involved in conveying the simple idea that the GM has personhood and divinity was certainly even greater. Outside the domain of sacred texts, the reinterpretation of verbal information must have taken place even more frequently: while one person may occasionally have spoken of the mantra as if  it was being endowed with divinity and personhood, another may have un-1093 There seems little reason to believe that two separate goddesses emerged. Rather, at best we can speak of two aspects of one goddess; see above pp. 239–240. 

270 ∙ gāyatRī: mantRa and motheR of the vedas derstood this as being about a mantra that, in fact, is  a divine being. One can therefore well imagine that at some point, one among them would eventually consider the GM a real deity and worship it as such, especially if he also knew authoritative texts that could support the idea. 

**Chapter 7 **\(“Identification with Sāvitrī”\) demonstrated, however, that the mantra did not become a goddess all on its own, so to speak. The emergence of the mantra goddess was also facilitated by another process, namely the identification of the mantra with a pre-existent goddess. To my knowledge, this first happens in the MBh in the famous Sāvitrī story. In this story, the childless king Aśvapati repeats the GM – here still only called sāvitrī – a great many times. After eighteen years, this approach bears fruit, as a goddess called Sāvitrī appears before him and promises that he will obtain a daughter: the princess Sāvitrī. 

Later versions of the story leave little doubt that the Sāvitrī is no longer only a divine mantra, but also an anthropomorphic goddess. 

As a close reading of the text shows, however, Aśvapati’s recitation of the sāvitrī  does not necessarily have to be interpreted as the intentional worship of a mantra goddess. As a matter of fact, a goddess called Sāvitrī already existed before the mantra was deified, and probably before it was even composed. In the ṚV, we learn of Sūryā, a solar divinity that came to be recognized as Savitṛ’s daughter, and as such was later also called Sūryā Sāvitrī. Her mytheme was characterized by three different elements: her role as the archetypical bride; the self-choice of her spouse; and her association with twins, in the Vedic case, the Aśvins. To varying degrees these three elements are even detectable in other IE

mythical characters, which makes it likely that they go back to a PIE precursor. 

While in the epic story, the goddess herself appears only briefly, at least two of her characteristics are present in the princess who is named after her: Sāvitrī, who is also explicitly said to be like her eponym, is said to be very beautiful, and she also chooses her husband herself. These resemblances suggest that the goddess Sāvitrī was indeed Sūryā Sāvitrī’s successor, or her manifestation in epic literature. The goddess and the mantra of the same name had never before connected. I suggested that bringing them together may have been so surprising that it had a comical effect. But irrespective of whether this was the case or not, the story is the earliest evidence for a fully anthropomorphic deification of the mantra. 

The goddess Sūryā/Sāvitrī seems to have added what the deification of the mantra had been missing so far: agency, as well as an appealing anthropomorphic form. Already the very idea of associating the goddess called Sāvitrī with the mantra called sāvitrī  may have facilitated the deification of the latter. The originally independent goddess Sūryā/Sāvitrī, on the other hand, thereby acquired a new manifestation. Depending on the perspective, one could think of the goddess either as a deity that manifests in, but is essentially independent

of, the mantra – a mantra goddess – or as the deified form of the mantra itself, now having a visually perceptible, or imagined, form.¹⁰⁹⁴ As later texts show, the second conception became the more important one. 

Chapters 6 and 7 both identified various factors that probably contributed to the deification of the mantra: the personification of the mantra in the JaimUB, the GopB, and various Dharma texts; the deification of the gāyatrī  meter; and the association and even identification of the mantra with a pre-existent goddess. In Chapter 5, we also observed that the mantra was worshipped alongside deities such as Indra and Prajāpati \(without, however, being actually personified\).¹⁰⁹⁵ During the course of the first millennium ce, most of these developments and relationships faded into the background or came to an end altogether. 

The most important source contributing to the conception of the deified GM became the mantra itself. 

As shown in **Chapter 8 **\(“The Mantra Goddess”\), in Classical and early-medieval Hinduism, the qualities of the mantra were gradually integrated into the personality of its deification. “Mother of the Vedas” \( vedamātṛ\) became the most important epithet and second name of the emerging goddess. The designation was based on the role of the mantra as the epitome of the Vedas. This conception was turned on its head: while originally, the mantra was thought to have been extracted from  the Vedas, it now became their source. However, despite the fact that it was used for a goddess who was, by that time, certainly believed to be real and was regularly worshipped by many, this personification always remained metaphorical. Just as in the case of the mother of the initiate, the deification of the mantra was not conceived of as an actual mother goddess. 

In one MBh story, the mantra goddess is even portrayed as a girl, “giving birth” 

to the \(anthropomorphic\) Vedas by emitting them from her mouth. 

Sometime during the middle third of the first millennium ce, the mantra goddess was also conflated with Sarasavatī, who is well known as the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning, music, and the arts. Both Sāvitrī and Sarasvatī

were thought to be Brahmā’s wife. The idea that they could be one and the same suggested itself, and they were indeed identified with each other. As a result, Brahmā once and for all replaced Savitṛ as Sāvitrī’s father. Here we can observe that the identities of deities can be very fluid, perhaps even more fluid than that of literary characters.¹⁰⁹⁶ In Bāṇa’s Harṣ., for example, Sāvitrī and Sarasvatī play the roles of two befriended goddesses and are therefore – inevitably – strictly distinguished. 

1094 Cf. above pp. 24–28 \(Section 3.2\). 

1095 In Chapter 8, I also briefly deal with passages in the CarS and the JaimGS that possibly prefigure her worship in the Sandhyā; see above pp. 247–248. 

1096 Cf. above pp. 24–25. 

272 ∙ gāyatRī: mantRa and motheR of the vedas Continuing from observations made in Chapter 6, I turned to later versions of the Sandhyā liturgy, and in doing so focused on the goddess herself rather than on the process of deification. As we saw, the goddess came to occupy a central position in the Sandhyā, which is why I suggested calling her a “Sandhyā goddess.” Three verses dedicated to her were reused in several versions of the Sandhyā liturgy \(according to the BaudhGŚS, two of them were even used for the worship of Sarasvatī\). The Sandhyā became the most important ritual in which the deified GM was worshipped, and also became a hub for a multitude of new ideas and concepts surrounding the goddess. Texts such as the MNārUĀn, AVPar XLI, and the ĀśvGSPar use Tantric forms to add further details to the mantra and its deification, but fill these forms with Vedic content. Looking at the development of the mantra goddess in these texts, we can observe that she became much more visual. Two modes of anthropomorphism, which are frequently intertwined, can be distinguished: on the one hand, the description of parts of the text of the mantra as body parts; on the other, the elaboration of the figure of the goddess herself. 

Notwithstanding this increase of visual elements, the elaboration of her anthropomorphic manifestation, and her identification with Sarasvatī, the Mother of the Vedas or Sandhyā goddess remained, above all, the deification of a mantra. In contrast to Sarasvatī’s river \(which, at some point, dried up and was then replaced by various other rivers\), the mantra could always be made manifest by means of recitation. This was probably one of the reasons why very few temples were dedicated to the goddess: every place and time where the recitation of Vedic texts was permitted was also an opportunity to worship her.
