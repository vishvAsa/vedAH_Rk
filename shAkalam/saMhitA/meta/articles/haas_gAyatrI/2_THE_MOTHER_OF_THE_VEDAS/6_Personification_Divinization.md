**Deification**

**Introduction**

Part I has shown that the status of the Gāyatrī-Mantra in Early Hinduism continued to increase after it had been made the primary initiation mantra. But while the religious manuals produced in that period reflect this increase in status in a number of ritual developments, they nowhere personify the mantra, even when attributing divinity to it. The most straightforward explanation for this is that the GM was not \(yet\) consistently considered a full-fledged deity, at least not by the practitioners and codifiers of the “orthoprax” ritualistic religion. In this chapter, however, we will see that the idea of a mantra goddess had already had precursors in this period. 

Evidence for the earliest traces of the personification and divinization of the mantra is found in a small number of passages in several “Vedic” texts: the Jaiminīya-Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa \(JaimUB\), the GopB, the MNārU \(also transmitted as part of the TaittĀ\), and the AV. I have put the adjective “Vedic” in quotation marks for a reason: the text passages to be discussed are, in fact, all from the post-Vedic period \(with perhaps the exception of the JaimUB\) as defined by linguistic criteria.⁷²⁷ At least in two cases, the MNārU and the AV, the text remained subject to changes even well beyond this period.⁷²⁸ The attribute “Vedic” 

is, therefore, far from unambiguous. The order in which the texts are listed is deliberately chosen as well. Traditionally, Vedic texts are classified according to a quasi-chronological scheme comprising Saṃhitās, Brāhmaṇas, Āraṇyakas, and Upaniṣads. It has long been known, however, that this scheme is somewhat too simple.⁷²⁹ In the case of the text passage we will deal with in this chapter, it will indeed be of no help at all. 

727 For a summary of the special features of Vedic as compared to Classical Sanskrit, see VGS: 236–243. 

728 Cf. also n. 333 on p. 80 above. 

729 Cf., for instance, Gonda 1975: 22: “The ideas of chronological succession of ‘literary genres’ and of corresponding forms of religious interest can no longer be maintained.”

While focusing on late-Vedic and Early Hindu texts, I will inevitably anticipate some of the later developments of the GM and its/her worship, in one case even touching upon Tantric elements⁷³⁰ \(especially when discussing the additions and modifications in the MNārU\). In several cases I will also use passages from later texts in order to clarify the purport of earlier ones. By considering all these texts, I will thus span a quite wide historical arc. In general, however, I will again concentrate on the early period and on the processes contributing to the mantra’s deification rather than on its results. It is also for this reason that the concept of the “Mother of the Vedas,” which we will encounter for the first time in this chapter, will only be discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.⁷³¹

The present chapter consists of two major sections \(**Section 1**: “Personification and divinization”; **Section 2**: “Deification”\), each containing two subsec-tions. 

• **Section 1.1 **\(pp. 175–178\) deals with the JaimUB, in which first traces of a personification as well as divinization of the GM can be detected: the mantra here appears as the partner or spouse of the Vedic god Savitṛ. 

• **Section 1.2 **\(pp. 178–183\) briefly discusses a passage from the GopB. This very late Brāhmaṇa not only reuses the textual material of the JaimUB, but also adds several new passages that further elaborate upon the personification of the mantra, which/who is now also given the name “Mother of the Vedas.” Moreover, I also consider a number of passages from the Dharma literature. 

• **Section 2.1 **\(pp. 184–193\) introduces the MNārU, a text that continued to grow and diversify throughout centuries. This highly complex text touches virtually on every single aspect of the deification of the GM relevant to this study. In particular, its several recensions very well reflect the various stages in the long-term development of the deification of the GM. 

• **Section 2.2 **\(pp. 193–197\) deals with the so-called vedamātṛ  verse, a piece of religious poetry that has been reused in several texts and is also included in one version of the MNārU. A dedicated treatment of this verse is above all justified by the fact that it was also included in the AV, generally deemed to be one of the most ancient Vedic texts.⁷³² Moreover, the vedamātṛ  verse is \(in all of its versions\) so corrupt that its restoration requires more detailed argumentation. 

730 These elements are found in the latest recension of the Upaniṣad, the Āndhra recension, and are most likely later than the fifth century ce. 

731 See below pp. 234–240. 

732 Its significance has so far been unclear; cf. Brereton 2022: 78: “\[I\]t is difficult to connect this highly uncertain evidence with the status or role of the Gāyatrī in other Vedas.”

**1. Personification and divinization**

The last two sections of the Sāmavedic JaimUB,⁷³³ IV 27–28,⁷³⁴ consist of a brief text entirely dedicated to Savitṛ and the sāvitrī. The position of this text at the very end of the JaimUB suggests that it belongs to the “later appendices.”⁷³⁵

It was also reused in an Atharvavedic text, the GopB. \(Moreover, in combination with a short appendix, it also came to be known as the Sāvitrī-Upaniṣad

\[SāvU\], a possibly medieval text that due to its very late age will only be treated in passing here.\) The khaṇḍa s 31–38 in GopB I 1⁷³⁶ reuse and modify much of the JaimUB text and provide it with a frame story. khaṇḍa  33 in particular is verbally similar to JaimUB IV 27; khaṇḍa s 34–36, in turn, are concerned with the interpretation of the GM, just like JaimUB IV 28. GopB I 1.31–38 has also been called

“Gāyatrī Upaniṣad \(see also Gāyatra-Upaniṣad\)”⁷³⁷ or “Sāvitrī-Upaniṣad.”⁷³⁸

Among the two texts, the JaimUB is clearly the earlier one, as it is largely coeval with the BṛhĀU and the ChāndU, probably composed between 800 and 500 bce.⁷³⁹ The date of the various parts of the GopB, which is generally considered a very “late” Vedic text, has been the subject of debate.⁷⁴⁰ Its first part, however, is probably even younger than the Aṣṭādhyāyī, composed in or around the fourth century bce.⁷⁴¹ It is thus certainly posterior to JaimUB IV 27–28. 

**1.1 Jaiminīya-Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa**

For the purpose of this chapter, the content of JaimUB IV 27–28 is perhaps better summarized than translated in full.⁷⁴² In section 27, the same question is re-733 The text is also known as Śāṭyāyanī-Gāyatrasya-Upaniṣad. Bodewitz \(2019 \[¹1986\]\): 86–

87 argues that it is rather an Āraṇyaka than an Upaniṣad or a Brāhmaṇa; Fujii \(2011: 106\), on the other hand, considers it the “earliest Upaniṣad”; see Fujii 1997: 89–90 and 2010: 31, n. 100. Its last two sections, however, are later, see Fujii 1997: 94.

736 Translated by Mitra & Vidyábhushaṇa 1872: 19–24 and Patyal 1969: 32–41. Note that Patyal variously translated the word sāvitrī  with “Gāyatrī” or “Sāvitrī.”

739 For the date of the JaimUB, see the references to Fujii’s works given in n. 733. 

740 For an introduction, see Gonda 1975: 355. Interestingly, the significance of this source for the history of the GM was recognized quite early. At a time when all works called “Brāhmaṇa” were still thought to be ancient, one of the first editors of the GopB remarked that “\[t\]he account given of the Gáyatrí is the fullest I have met with in the Vedas, and will perhaps be interesting to many as containing the oldest ideas of the Bráhmaṇas on the subject.” Mitra & Vidyábhushaṇa 1872: 19. Cf. also Lal 1971: 227: “In brief, the mantra had here attained a metaphysical importance.” 

741 Jamison & Witzel 1992: 11. The GopB certainly existed in the ninth century ce; see Kataoka 2007; cf. Griffiths 2007: 180.

peated nine times: kaḥ savitā kā sāvitrī, literally: “What⁷⁴³ is Savitṛ, what is the sāvitrī?” or “What is the Impeller \(m.\)? what is the one \(f.\) belonging/related to the Impeller?” After each question, the text answers by identifying the two with other entities that are in some way linked to each other, for example: “Savitṛ is the wind, the sāvitrī  is space. Where there is wind, there is space, and where there is space, respectively, there is wind” \( vāyur eva savitā ākāśas sāvitrī | sa yatra vāyus tad ākāśo yatra vākāśas tad vāyuḥ\). 

Nine such male/female pairs are given: \(1\) fire/earth; \(2\) Varuṇa/waters; \(3\) wind/space; \(4\) sacrifice/meters; \(5\) thunder/lightning; \(6\) sun/sky; \(7\) moon/ lunar stations; \(8\) mind/speech; \(9\) man/woman.⁷⁴⁴ After each pair, the text states that Savitṛ and the sāvitrī “are the two wombs/origins/sources” 

and that “they are one coupling” \( te dve yonī tad ekaṃ mithunam\). The main message is clear: Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  complement each other, they represent an ideal couple. They are the primordial sources – of the entire universe, one might infer. 

The imagery employed by the text is not really innovative. Already in the earlier Vedic literature, couples are compared to both natural and ritual pairs. In the AV, for instance, after a newly wedded couple has first united, the husband has to address his wife reciting the text “A ‘he’ am I, a ‘she’ are you; the melody am I, you are the verse; the sky am I, you are the earth.”⁷⁴⁵ Here, too, we find both ritual and natural pairs side-by-side. What is new in the JaimUB is that it is Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  who are connected in this way. 

In my view, the idea of making them a couple is based on the mythical and ritual functions typically associated with Savitṛ. As the impeller and initiator of everything, this god was also strongly connected with procreation.⁷⁴⁶ As I show in Chapters 4 and 5, his functions were very significant for the employment of the sāvitrī s, especially the GM, which soon became the “prototypical first verse.” This might be the reason why Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  are said to be “the two wombs” \( yonī\) in the first section: as “wombs” or “sources,” they stand at the very beginning of things. The theme of procreation is also found in the link between the sections 27 and 28, which is established through similar words: two times, the text states that “the sacrifice impels \( pra\+ cud\); woman and man 743 ka  can mean either “who?” or “what?,” depending on the context. The answers to questions given in the JaimUB suggests that here it means “what?.” For the “inverse” agree-ment of pronouns with their reference words within the same sentence, see Brereton 1986: 99–102; cf. also AS: 565, SS: 18. 

744 \(1\) agni/ pṛthivī; \(2\) varuṇa/ ap \(plural\); \(3\) vāyu/ ākāśa; \(4\) yajña/ chandas \(plural\); \(5\) stanayitnu/ vidyut; \(6\) āditya/ dyu; \(7\) candra/ nakṣatra \(plural\); \(8\) manas/ vāc; \(9\) puruṣa/ strī.

propagate \( pra\+ jan\).”⁷⁴⁷ The idea is that both the god and his most important mantra have the same “impelling or propagating power.” 

Another aspect opens up if we consider the general symbolism behind the relationship between husband and wife, or male and female in general, in \(late-\)Vedic times.⁷⁴⁸ The JaimUB passage itself provides some clues. In several identifications of the JaimUB, the male part “moves through” or “governs” the female part: wind moves through space, the sun through the sky; fire “moves” 

above the earth. Varuṇa, on the other hand, is the god who presides over water in general; the structure of the ritual determines which meters are to be used;⁷⁴⁹

the mind controls speech. 

While the passage certainly implies the interdependence and unity of the couple – several pairs merely indicate complementarity or co-occurrence⁷⁵⁰ –

the imagery employed also reveals that the male part was thought to be more mobile or to move within or through the female part. Although one could well imagine it the other way around, in ancient South Asia, this mobility also indicated a kind of primacy or sovereignty.⁷⁵¹ In a culture where the ideal role of a woman is that of a stationary housewife, this may come as little surprise. 

The relationship between Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  can be construed along these lines: Savitṛ “permeates” the sāvitrī, whose name is derived from his.⁷⁵²

The sāvitrī  is entirely dedicated to him, as it were. His power is “channelled” 

through the sāvitrī, he impels by means of it; where a sāvitrī  is recited, Savitṛ is present. The power of the mantra is derived from – and the same as – the power of the god. 

But while they may be presented as a couple, this does not mean that their relationship is symmetrical: the sāvitrī  in the JaimUB can hardly be understood as an independent goddess on the same ontological level as Savitṛ, even though she is his partner. On the contrary, the passage still makes sense if the sāvitrī  is simply understood to be a potent formula, even if a divine one. In section 28, the text focuses completely on the interpretation of the three pāda s of the GM. 

Knowledge of the supposedly hidden or esoteric meaning of the text is stressed; the idea of personifying the mantra, on the other hand, is not taken up again. 

747 JaimUB IV 28.3,5: yajño \( vai\) pracodayati; strī ca vai puruṣaś ca prajanayataḥ. 

748 See generally Dange 1979. 

749 For the relationship between the sacrifice the meters, see Thite 1987: 435–438. 

750 E.g., thunder/lightning or perhaps also sacrifice/meters. In the GopB, day/night and heat/

cold are complementary; cf. n. 762 on p. 179 below. 

751 Sovereignty was often conceived of as the freedom of movement, especially in the case of the sun; see Proferes 2007: 49–51. The “universal ruler,” too, was often called cakravartin: literally a cakravartin  is someone “who makes the wheels \[of his chariot\] roll \[without being obstructed\],” which means that he can go wherever he wants; cf. Bronkhorst 2011: 103, n. 11. 

752 Interestingly, the wives of Agni, Indra and Varuṇa are also named after their husbands: Agnāyī, Indrāṇī, and Varuṇānī. None of them have ever developed a distinctive profile; see Macdonell 2002 \[¹1916\]: 125. 

178 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas

References to other mythical or ritual concepts that may indicate deification or at least personification, such as the myth of \(Sūryā\) Sāvitrī,⁷⁵³ the idea that initiation is a rebirth by means of the sāvitrī,⁷⁵⁴ or the metaphor of the Mother of the Vedas,⁷⁵⁵ are missing entirely. The passage concludes that “\[h\]e who knows this sāvitrī  thus overcomes second death, he wins the same world with the sāvitrī  itself; he wins the same world with the sāvitrī  itself.”⁷⁵⁶ The expression “to win the same world with the sāvitrī” might at first give the impression that the sāvitrī  must be a goddess. However, in Vedic literature the expression is used in combination with all kinds of entities, including days, the year, meters, or the cardinal directions.⁷⁵⁷

**1.2 Gopatha-Brāhmaṇa and Dharma literature**

In the GopB, the passage JaimUB IV 27–28 has been reworked and expanded. 

Significantly, the frame story of this text introduces the themes of studentship and initiation. In this story, a certain Vedic expert, Glāva Maitreya, is speaking \(soliloquizing, as it seems\) ill of one of his colleagues, Maudgalya Ekādaśākṣa. 

A student of Maudgalya’s overhears this and reports it to his teacher, who then orders him to test the insulter’s knowledge by asking him a question about the GM:

Teach \[me\], sir, the sāvitrī gāyatrī, which has twenty-four wombs, twelve couplings, whose eyes are the Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases,⁷⁵⁸ \(tell \[me\] about the sāvitrī\) on which all this here rests – explain this \( sāvitrī\), sir\!⁷⁵⁹

Glāva is unable to talk about the subject and, defeated, approaches Maudgalya in order to become his student and to learn about the sāvitrī: 753 See below pp. 204–212. 

754 See above p. 145. 

755 See below pp. 234–240. 

756 JaimUB IV 28.6: yo vā etāṃ sāvitrīm evaṃ vedāpa punarmṛtyuṃ tarati sāvitryā eva salokatāṃ jayati sāvitryā eva salokatāṃ jayati; tr. Oertel 1896: 225 \(I have replaced

“Sāvitrī” with “sāvitrī”\). 

757 Cf., for instance, the following statement: “For the quarters \[or “cardinal directions”\]

joined in the song. He thus wins the same world with the quarters.” diśo hy upāgāyan diśām evaṃ salokatāṃ jayatīti  JaimUB I 22.4; tr. Oertel 1896: 100. For more on these and similar expressions, see Gonda 1966: 113–115; cf. also Shults 2013: 112–119. 

758 The Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases are sages strongly associated with the AV \(as well as with the MBh; see Bronkhorst 2016: 236–240\). The exact meaning of the expression “eyes of the Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases,” however, is unclear to me; possibly, the idea is to emphasize that the GM is also important for the Atharvavedic tradition. \(Note that the mantra nowhere appears in the AV itself; see above pp. 63–67.\)

759 GopB I 1.31: 23.12–14: adhīhi bhoḥ sāvitrīṃ gāyatrīṃ caturviṃśatiyoniṃ dvādaśamithunāṃ

yasyā bhṛgvaṅgirasaś cakṣur yasyāṃ sarvam idaṃ śritaṃ tāṃ bhavān prabravītv iti; also translated by Patyal 1969: 33. 

chapteR 6 ∙ peRsonification, divinization, deification ∙ 179

Having approached him, he \[i.e., Glāva\] asked \[Maudgalya\]: “Pray, sir, what do the poets call Savitṛ’s excellent effulgence, what do they call thoughts? Tell if you know those through which the propelling \( pra\+ cud, 

“setting in motion, spurring on”\) Savitṛ moves\!” 

Thereupon he told him: “The Vedas, the meters\(/ metrical Vedic texts\), that excellent effulgence of the god Savitṛ – the poets call that food; thoughts are rituals – that I teach you – through which the propelling \( pra\+ cud\) Savitṛ moves.” Embracing him \[by the feet\], he asked: “Recite, sir: What is Savitṛ, what is the sāvitrī?”⁷⁶⁰

The following text basically follows the structure of JaimUB IV 27, using its formulations almost verbatim.⁷⁶¹ The number of male/female pairs, however, is expanded from nine to twelve: \(1\) mind/speech; \(2\) fire/earth; \(3\) wind/

interspace; \(4\) sun/sky; \(5\) moon/ lunar stations; \(6\) day/night; \(7\) heat/cold; \(8\) rain cloud /rain; \(9\) lightning/thunder; \(10\) breath \(vital force\) /food; \(11\) Vedas/meters; \(12\) sacrifice/fees.⁷⁶² After these pairs, the text speculates extensively about the three pāda s of the GM. The interpretation has little to do with the actual text of the mantra, but simply connects elements typically given in threes \(e.g., ṛc, yajus, sāman\) with its pāda s. For this and for reasons of space, I will not give a full translation of it here. 

There is, however, an interesting aspect I would like to highlight: the mention of the brahmacārin. As we saw above, in the frame story of the text, Glāva becomes the student of Maudgalya. The theme is taken up again in the transi-760 GopB I 1.32: 25.5–11: taṃ hopetya papraccha kiṃ svid āhur bhoḥ savitur vareṇyaṃ bhargo devasya kavayaḥ kim āhur dhiyo vicakṣva yadi tāḥ pravettha pracodayānt savitā yābhir etīti tasmā etat provāca vedāṃś chandāṃsi savitur vareṇyam bhargo devasya kavayo ’nnam āhuḥ karmāṇi dhiyas tad u te prabravīmi pracodayānt savitā yābhir etīti tam upasaṃgṛhya papracchādhīhi bhoḥ kaḥ savitā kā sāvitrī. Half of the manuscripts used for the critical edition read pracodayant \(see Gaastra 1919: 25, n. 8\), which is grammatically correct. 

However, I consider it very likely that even the author did not dare to shorten the long ā  in order to preserve the most salient feature of pracodáyāt, a Vedic form that was no longer in use at his time. pracodayān  would then be the lectio difficilior. Patyal’s \(1969: 35, n. 2\) emendation to pracodayāt  and his translation has to be rejected. 

761 There are only minor differences: the phrase te dve yonī tad ekam mithunam  in the JaimUB

is changed to ete dve yonī ekaṃ mithunam; sa yatra … yatra vā …  is changed to yatra hy eva … yatra vai … iti. 

762 \(1\) manas/ vāc; \(2\) agni/ pṛthivī \(3\) vāyu/ antarikṣa \(4\) āditya/ dyu; \(5\) candramas/

nakṣatra \(plural\); \(6\) ahar/ rātri; \(7\) uṣṇa/ śīta \(8\) abhra/ varṣa \(9\) vidyut/ stanayitnu; \(10\) prāṇa/ anna \(11\) veda \(plural\) / chandas \(plural\); \(12\) yajña/ dakṣinā \(plural\). In comparing this list with that of the JaimUB, we observe that the order is slightly different. 

Moreover, the pairs Varuṇa/waters and man/woman are dropped; wind/space is changed to wind/interspace, sacrifice/meters is changed to sacrifice/fees, thunder/lightning is re-versed and becomes lightning/thunder. Four pairs are entirely new: day/night; heat/cold; rain cloud/rain; breath \(vital force\)/food. Interestingly, the pairs day/night as well as heat/cold are opposites; however, they can still be said to be complementary. 

180 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas

tional text between the passage dealing with the pairs and the speculation about the mantra, spoken by the instructor, Maudgalya:

“Then, having stood up, he went forth”⁷⁶³ – \[and about him\] this indeed I know: Gone into these wombs, coming into being from these couplings, my brahmacārin  will not die before \[the end of\] his full lifespan. |33| For brahman  regarded this abode⁷⁶⁴ as a radiation foundation. Practice that austerity\! If that \[abode\] is maintained in the observance \( vrata \[i.e., in brahmacarya\]\), it has established \[the student\] in truth. Having created⁷⁶⁵

a \[twice-born\] Brahmin with/ by means of /from the sāvitrī, that Savitṛ

enveloped/entrusted \[him with \(?\)\] the sāvitrī.⁷⁶⁶

What can be gleaned from this \(somewhat corrupt\) passage is that Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  are not only a perfect couple, but are, in a sense, also the parents of the brahmacārin, who is also figuratively said to be “born from these couplings” \( mithunebhyaḥ saṃbhūtaḥ\). Moreover, Savitṛ might also be the creator of Brahmins in general: depending on how one reads the sentence, he either created them “by means of the sāvitrī” or, possibly, “together with  the sāvitrī” 

\(or “Sāvitrī”\), his partner. 

A number of similar metaphors in several \(younger\) Dharma texts may be fruitfully compared. One, the earliest⁷⁶⁷ among them, is perhaps a passage from 763 In the ChāndU \(VIII 9.2, 10.3, 11.2\), the verb pra\+ vraj  is used to describe a student \(in this case, Indra\) departing from the teacher after being instructed. In the GopB passage the verb seems to be used in the same meaning. 

764 Lubin suggested that “āyatana  likely refers to the agnyāyatana, the fire enclosure, which is where the brahmacārin  is supposed to toil, tending the fire. This is another symbol of the womb” \(personal communication, September 19, 2022\). 

765 Interestingly, in MBh V 106.10, Savitṛ is once said to be the “primeval enunciator” of the sāvitrī. 

766 GopB I 1.33–34: 27.5–10: athotthāya prāvrājīd ity etad vā ahaṃ veda naitāsu yoniṣv ita etebhyo vā mithunebhyaḥ saṃbhūto brahmacārī mama purāyuṣaḥ preyād iti |33| brahma hedaṃ śriyaṃ pratiṣṭhām āyatanam aikṣata tat tapasva yadi tad vrate dhriyeta tat satye pratyatiṣṭhat sa savitā sāvitryā brāhmaṇaṃ sṛṣṭvā tat sāvitrīṃ paryadadhāt; also translated by Patyal 1969: 37–38. paryadadhāt  literally means “enveloped”; possibly it is confused with paryadadāt  it “entrusted.” Lubin suggested that it refers to the pāda-by- pāda  recitation that is part of the sāvitryupadeśa \(see above pp. 111–112\), with the image being that the brahmacārin  is “wrapped” in the mantra \(personal communication, September 19, 2022\). 

767 An older, somewhat obscure and isolated passage is also found in the Baudhāyana-Śrautasūtra \(BaudhŚS XII 18; also translated by Kashikar 2003: 783\). In the middle of the Rājasūya, two pairs of people enter the sacrificial enclosure. Those already present allow entry only to those who can trace their female ancestors back up to the tenth generation. If, however, “one says: ‘My mother is a Commoner \( vaiśyā\)’ or ‘\(the\) sāvitrī,’

they let him pass, saying: ‘Commoners \( viś\) are the protectors of marriages \[sic\]’” \( sa ya āha vaiśyā me mātā sāvitrīti vāti taṁ sṛjanti viśo vivāhān goptāra iti vadantaḥ\). The possible meaning of this is that someone who cannot claim Brahmin or Kṣatriya ancestry, but has nevertheless been duly initiated is admitted as well. The crucial point is that initiation is indispensable for marriage; see above p. 145. In contrast to Brahmins and Kṣatriyas, 

chapteR 6 ∙ peRsonification, divinization, deification ∙ 181

the youngest Dharmasūtra, the **VasDhS **\(with a parallel in the MBh\), a text that can roughly be dated to the first centuries ce \(and is, therefore, probably not too far removed in time from the GopB\). Here, however, the father is not Savitṛ, but the teacher. According to the text, “at first, birth is from the mother, the second is at the tying of the Muñja-grass girdle. In the latter, the sāvitrī  is his mother, while the teacher is said to be the father.”⁷⁶⁸

The **MānDhŚ**, in turn, mentions both the natural mother and father, but does not reproduce the analogy with the same explicitness in the case of the sāvitrī  and the teacher:

That mother and father produce him jointly out of desire, that he is born in a womb – that he should know as his coming into existence. 

But the birth which the teacher who has mastered the Veda produces according to the rules through the sāvitrī – that one is real, free from aging and free from death.⁷⁶⁹

In the second verse, the instrumental sāvitryā might  be read in a way as to imply that the sāvitrī  is the mother. However, it is equally possible that it only plays the role of an instrument, especially when considering that it is the teacher who is said to “bring about the birth” \( jātiṃ- … utpādayati\). Read in this way,

Vaiśyas were perhaps less often able to present as impressive a pedigree but are here given the benefit of the doubt. If, on the other hand, someone says that his mother is the sāvitrī, this implies that only he himself had been initiated – possibly because his birth mother was not even a proper Vaiśyā. Admitting such people was perhaps a concession to the fact that in reality, many dvija s were not able to show that their ancestors had been dvija s as well – a thought that is so not far-fetched considering that originally only Brahmins were initiated; see above p. 143. If this interpretation is correct, the BaudhŚS

would be the earliest text to give evidence for the mother metaphor. For the importance of the maternal lineage for the legitimacy and status in the case of Hindu rulers, see Falk 2006: 148–153. 

768 VasDhS II 3: mātur agre vijananaṃ dvitīyaṃ mauñjibandhane / atrāsya mātā sāvitrī pitā tv ācārya ucyate //; cf. the translations by Olivelle 2000: 355 and Kajihara 2019: 4, n. 12. The second half of the verse has a parallel in the MBh: VasDhS II 3cd ≈ MBh III 177.29cd: tatrāsya mātā sāvitrī pitā tv ācārya ucyate / \(tr. van Buitenen II: 565\). The context in the Epic, however, is the ritual to be performed after the \(natural\) birth \( jātakarman\), and not the Upanayana. Van Buitenen \(II: 830; cf. MCI  I: 219\) explains that “sāvitrī” therefore does not refer to the GM, but to another Savitṛ verse; see, for instance, ŚāṅkhGS I 24.4

and ĀśvGS I 15.1 \(tr. Oldenberg, SBE  XXIX: 50 and 182\). In the star passage MBh III 177.29\*88 an attempt is made to rectify this unusual reference by supplying a mention of the Upanayana \(“after that, the naming ritual; after that, the tonsure is prescribed; after that, the Upanayana of those who have a second birth is explained according to the rules.” tatas tu nāmakaraṇaṃ tataś caulaṃ vidhīyate / tatopanayanaṃ proktaṃ dvijātīnāṃ

yathāvidhi //\). 

769 MānDhŚ II 147–148: kāmān mātā pitā cainaṃ yad utpādayato mithaḥ / saṃbhūtiṃ tasya tāṃ vidyād yad yonāv abhijāyate /147/ ācāryas tv asya yāṃ jātiṃ vidhivad vedapāra-gaḥ utpādayati sāvitryā sā satyā sājarāmarā /148/. Cf. the translation by Olivelle 2005: 102. 

182 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas

the MānDhŚ is similar to the KaṭhB, where the sāvitrī  is not personified, but nevertheless connected to the second birth of the student.⁷⁷⁰

Notwithstanding minor uncertainties, taken together these parallel passages indicate that the idea that the GM plays the role of a mother of the initiate must have been quite common around the time when the Dharmasūtras were being composed. None of the Dharmasūtra passages, however, show any trace of a divinity or deity. The personification of the mantra seems to be nothing more than a trope.⁷⁷¹

In the GopB and in the JaimUB, in contrast, the GM forms a couple with Savitṛ, a full-fledged Vedic god. Depending on how “seriously” one takes this text, this makes it difficult not to consider it a divinity of some kind.⁷⁷² But does that mean that its recipients consequently conceived of it as a real deity, perhaps even as an anthropomorphic deity like Savitṛ? As we saw in Chapter 5, personification is not a prerequisite for becoming an object of worship: in several Gṛhya rituals, the sāvitrī  is worshipped \(alongside the Vedas, the meters, etc.\) in the same way as other, “proper” gods like Indra or Prajāpati.⁷⁷³ But we also saw that the sāvitrī  was considered a divine mantra rather than an independent deity, let alone an anthropomorphic goddess.⁷⁷⁴

To a large extent, the same seems to apply to the GopB. The focus of the GopB text, too, lies on the mantra and its powerful secrets, and promises much for those who know it.⁷⁷⁵ Only towards the end of the text is the personification further elaborated, as the text concludes: “He who knows thus and who, knowing thus, thus worships this Mother of the Vedas, the sāvitrī, as success, as a secret \( upaniṣad\) – he attains infinite splendor/prosperity \( śrī\) – thus \(ends\) the Brāhmaṇa.”⁷⁷⁶ This colophon – which could very well be a later addition –

clearly personifies the mantra. While it/she is still primarily an object of knowledge, it/she is also called the “Mother of the Vedas.” 

This personification of a divine mantra might be a considered a small step taken towards the concept of a “mantra goddess”: as still later texts show, at 770 See above p. 145. 

771 It is worth noting that entering brahmacarya  involved the boy’s separation from his mother. It is doubtful whether any young brahmacārin  would have accepted a mantra as an appropriate substitute. However, we may assume that the attribution of the role of mother had a reinforcing effect on the personification of the mantra during this sensitive transitional phase and created a memory that remained for the rest of the dvija’s life. 

772 Cf. Varenne, EU: “Ainsi la Sāvitrī est, en premier lieu, la prière adressée au dieu incitateur \( Savitṛ\), mais elle est en même temps la puissance créatrice \( śakti\) de ce dieu; et il est, en ce sens, légitime de la tenir pour une déesse. ” 

773 See above pp. 153–159. 

774 See above pp. 156–159. 

775 Cf. the translation of this passage by Falk 1986b: 85–86.

chapteR 6 ∙ peRsonification, divinization, deification ∙ 183

least some recipients of the text did take it quite literally.⁷⁷⁷ The much later SāvU, which adaptively reuses the text from the JaimUB, for instance, bluntly calls her mahādevī, “great goddess.” Towards the end of this text, we read the following:

oṃ hRīṃ – O powerful, great goddess – hRīṃ – O you of great power –

Klīṃ – O you who give accomplishment of the fourfold goal of man, O

you whose nature is to grant the boon of “that \[excellent effulgence\] of the Sun\[-god\]”⁷⁷⁸ – hRīṃ – O you whose nature is to grant the boon of

“\[that\] excellent effulgence of the \[Sun-\]god,” O exceedingly powerful one, embodiment of compassion for all, powerful one, destroyer of all hunger and fatigue, born from “who may \[inspire\] our thoughts,” O bountiful one whose nature is to inspire,⁷⁷⁹ who by nature has the Humming \[i.e., the syllable om\] at/as her head – huṃ phaṭ svāhā\!⁷⁸⁰

It seems plausible \(to myself, at least\) that the authors of reworkings such as this one did not perceive their additions as alterations of the “original” meaning of the text. Rather, they well may have felt that texts such as the JaimUB actually are concerned with a goddess, and only adapted them somewhat in order to make this clearer. 

**2. Deification**

While in the JaimUB and GopB, the GM is only divinized to the extent to which –

and no further – it is the “mantric partner” of Savitṛ, another “Vedic” text invokes it as a goddess in her own right. This is the MNārU,⁷⁸¹ which at least in 777 It must be noted, however, that it is still unknown when the GopB was composed. It cannot be ruled out that at the time of its composition, the deification of the GM was already far more elaborate, but was deliberately ignored by the author, who here is only concerned with the mantra. 

778 As in the ŚvetU passage translated in Chapter 1 \(see above pp. 52–53\), I understand the pāda s cited here to be components of the new sentence that incorporate the rest of the mantra into the intended meaning, but have not been syntactically adapted. 

779 The compound pracodayātmika  cannot be analyzed as consisting of \* pracodaya\+ ātmika; the word \* pracodaya  does not exist. We may speculate that the author’s original idea was to formulate dhīmahi-dhiyo-yo-naḥ-pracodayād-ātmike \(analogously to the previous two pāda s\) – non liquet. 

780 SāvU 14: oṃ hrīṃ bale mahādevi hrīṃ mahābale klīṃ caturvidhapuruṣārthasiddhiprade tat-savitur-varadātmike hrīṃ vareṇyaṃ-bhargo-devasya-varadātmike atibale sarvadayāmūrta-ye bale ⁺ sarvakṣucchramopanāśini dhīmahi-dhiyo-yo-nar-jāte × pracure \[ed. pracuryā\] yā

part may have been composed around the beginning of the Common Era. In this Upaniṣad, we not only find the modified GMs, but also a passage dedicated to a goddess worshipped in the Sandhyā. While in the earliest version of the text this goddess is possibly only a deified form of the gāyatrī  meter, she soon was also identified with the GM. Moreover, some versions of this passage \(henceforth I will simply call it “the Gāyatrī passage”\) also contain a verse calling the GM the vedamātṛ – “the Mother of the Vedas.” This verse \(henceforth, to be called “the vedamātṛ  verse”\) was also included in the AV. 

In the following, I will first discuss the Gāyatrī passage in the MNārU before turning to the vedamātṛ  verse and its AV pendant. This passage is not free of corruptions, but especially in its prose parts its text is more intact than that of the vedamātṛ  verse, which is much more in need of textual restoration.

According to Robert Zimmermann, both the Āth and the even younger Ān recension, which is the version with the most insertions and additions, are based on the Dr recension.⁷⁸⁶ My goal in discussing the Gāyatrī passage is to trace the process of the GM’s deification from the earliest to the latest recension. To this 782 According to Sāyaṇa, there also exist Karṇātaka recensions \(cf. Zimmermann 1913: 7:

“Keine derselben hat sich trotz nachdrücklichen Suchens in Europa und Indien auffinden lassen”\); see also Sarma 1939: 69–70. 

783 prapāṭhaka  X, following the TaittU \(= prapāṭhaka s VII–IX\). Sarma \(1939: 68\) aptly remarked that “\[t\]he arrangement of the text of no other Vedic work is, perhaps, so uncertain as that of the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.” 

784 In addition, there is an appendix to TaittĀ X in Mitra 1872 containing text also found in the Ān. 

785 Note that this edition, notwithstanding its title, is not critical; see Gonda1963b: 299. 

786 Zimmermann 1913: 62–74. For the date of “the MNārU,” see Srinivasan 1997: 120–121. She tentatively suggests that it may have been composed some time in the first century ce. 

However, Srinivasan \(1997: 112\) explicitly proposes this date for the Ān recension, which

These two end points will provide the basis for my analysis of the development of the text, which will also open up the possibility of retracing the various stages of the deification of the GM. 

In the following, I present and translate the passage from the **Dr **recension.⁷⁸⁷ The two indented sections 28 and 29 are only found in the Dr and in the Āth, but not in the Ān.

is the latest of all recensions. The fact that this recension already uses the designation

“Gāyatrī” for the mantra suggests that the MNārUĀn may have been composed after the third century ce. However, insofar as Tantricization was a reaction to the strong  presence of Tantric traditions, the text more likely came into being even later, namely after \(or in\) the fifth century ce, and would hence belong to the “Tantric Age” \(the only terminus ante quem  I know of is given by Sāyaṇa, who lived in the fourteenth century ce and knew the text\). This oversight notwithstanding, the date proposed by Srinivasan may very well be correct – but for the earlier  recensions of the Upaniṣad, the Dr and Āth, or at least for earlier versions or precursors of these texts. 

787 For the Dr, see C: 847–851 and P: 743–74. Most of the text is identical with the \(unaccented\) passage Āth XV 1–5, for which see Jacob 1888: 14.19–15.12. 

788 The reading akṣare brahmasaṃmite “O imperishable one, equal to the brahman/Brahmā” 

as given in the MānGS \(see below pp. 189–190\) would make much more sense, but is not attested in the MNārU recensions.

also C: 914.11–915. I have chosen to present the Ān text as given in P rather than the text edited by Varenne \(Pa\) because the Ān gives accents. Since they are used very inconsistently, I have decided to transliterate them as they are instead of transcribing them. The linguistic value of these accent marks may be minimal; however, they illustrate very well the idiosyncratic treatment of Vedic accents by later scribes \(for the written transmission of Vedic texts in general, see Galewicz 2011\). Indeed, they most likely even point to the fact that the authors of these post-Vedic Vedic \(in the actual linguistic sense\) texts did not use correct forms in the first place, an observation that is of no little consequence when making – or more often, dispensing with – emendations and corrections; on this point see also n. 331 on p. 80 and n. 760 on p. 179 above.

Let us now analyze the development of ideas around the \(deified\) GM in light of the most significant changes between the passage in the Dr presented above and the latest recension, the Ān. First all, we observe that in the earliest version, the Dr, a deity called Gāyatrī is invoked, followed by a full quotation of the “augmented” sāvitrī  mantra. Only Gāyatrī, however, is explicitly called devī. 

In the Āth and Ān, on the other hand, it is difficult to differentiate between the various goddesses \(called not only “Gāyatrī” and “Sāvitrī,” but also “Sarasvatī”\); in fact, all of them appear to be manifestations of a single goddess. But was that already the case in the earliest version? The word chandas  can mean both

“meter” and “metrical Vedic text.”⁸¹⁵ Is the Gāyatrī the mother of the meters, of the metrical Vedic texts, or of both? Is only the meter deified, or are both the meter and the mantra supposed to be goddesses, or a  goddess? To answer these questions, let us have a look at a very similar passage from an entirely different text: the **MānGS**. 

Even at a superficial glance, it is easily assumed that the Gāyatrī passage found in the various recensions of the MNārU was not only intended to convey information about the meter or the mantra, but was used in ritual practice. At least in the Ān, we are explicitly told that upanayane viniyogaḥ, “the application is in the Upanayana.” While this is of course true for the GM, there are several indications that the entire text was, in fact, intended for the Sandhyā.⁸¹⁶ This is indicated by an instructive parallel in the MānGS:

Then he performs the Juncture \(worship\). |1| He goes out before sunset, sits down on a clean spot north of the village or east of it, washes himself, fills his cupped hands with water, turns right and invokes \[the goddess,⁸¹⁷

812 For the text and translation of this verse \(which is barely intelligible without reconstruction\), see the discussion below pp. 193–197. 

813 See n. 1045 on p. 249 below. 

814 Cf. the translation by Varenne 1960/I: 80–84 and the translations of individual verses in Gonda 1976: 74, n. 163 \(see pp. 183–184\). 

815 Pāṇini’s usage of the term was even broader; cf. Bronkhorst 2007: 188: “Pāṇini’s term chandas  covered more than just ‘Sacred Literature’. We may have to assume that certain works, primarily the ritual Sūtras, and among those first of all the Śrauta Sūtras, belonged to a fringe area wherein Vedic usage was sometimes considered appropriate.” 

816 Cf. also Mitra 1872: 70–72 and Varenne 1960/I: 79. 

817 The text does not specify who is to be invoked. Following the commentary, Dresden \(1941: 5\) here supplements “Savitr̥” instead of “the goddess.”

Gāyatrī, mother of the meters\(/ metrical texts\), find pleasure in this formulation \( brahman\) of mine\!” |2|

Having softly recited “You are vigor…”⁸¹⁸ and having combined⁸¹⁹ it with

“Who yokes for you…,”⁸²⁰ he employs eight times \[the formula\] “om –

Thus, the objects of desire are transmitted \[by tradition\].⁸²¹ He utters “Let the god \[Savitṛ\] drive here…” \[= ṚV VII 45.1\] as a triṣṭubh  for a Kṣatriya; 

“They harness…” \[= ṚV V 81.1\] as a jagatī  for a Vaiśya. |3|⁸²²

In this Gṛhyasūtra passage, three elements from the MNārU can be recognized: the verse addressing the goddess – in this case, in flawless \(reconstructed\) Sanskrit – the adaptive reuse of the TaittS passage, and, lastly, the GM itself \(in addition, the text also cites an unknown verse beginning with kas te yunakti\). 

This similar structure leaves no doubt that the MNārU’s Gāyatrī passage, too, was supposed to be recited in the Sandhyā. But is the Gāyatrī in this passage the mantra or the meter? At the very end of the quoted MānGS passage, the sāvitrī s in the two other meters are cited as well, which at first might suggest that the mantra is meant. The other sāvitrī s would then be Gāyatrīs in other meters \(a

“triṣṭubh  Gāyatrī,” etc.\), as it were – an odd, but not entirely impossible idea.⁸²³

Later reciters might indeed have understood the text in this way. Most likely, however, the sāvitrī s for the other Varṇas were only added to fulfil the scheme 818 See n. 790 on p. 185 above. 

819 Dresden \(1941: 5\) tentatively translated yojayitvā  as “folded \(his hands\)?.” 

820 An unknown verse \(cf. MānGS I 45\). Verses with similar pratīka s exist; see the UVC s.vv. 

“kas tvā yunakti sa tvā yunaktu,” “kas tvā yunakti sa tvā vi muñcatu,” “ko vo yunakti sa vo yunaktu,” and “ko vo yunakti.” However, it is difficult to establish a connection with the present verse. 

821 How the “objects of desire” have to be understood is unclear \(cf. Dresden 1941: 6\); possibly the objects of desire mentioned in the mantras, that is, ojas, bhargas, etc., are meant.

known from the Upanayana,⁸²⁴ without too much concern for the consequences. 

Their presence, therefore, does not really help to explain whether the mantra or the meter is meant. 

Given the ambiguity of the word chandas, the question is not easily answered. The MānGS itself evidently uses the word chandas  in the meanings

“meter” as well as “metrical/Vedic text” or even “Vedic literature.”⁸²⁵ There are, thus, at least two ways to understand the invocation: \(a\) the gāyatrī  meter is the mother of the meters, or \(b\), the GM is the mother of the metrical Vedic texts. 

Both options can be justified: the gāyatrī  meter was considered the “principal” 

meter, from which the other, longer meters were derived, as it were.⁸²⁶ As such, it could be easily called their mother. The GM, in turn, could just as easily be called the mother of the metrical Vedic texts. \(Pointing out the blatant similarity with the vedamātṛ \[or vedānāṃ mātṛ\] is probably not necessary.\) While we cannot rule out that both readings were valid, there are some indications that originally the meter was primary. The Gṛhyasūtras in general, including the MānGS, use sāvitrī  for the mantra and gāyatrī  for the meter.⁸²⁷ Indeed, the same holds true for most of the MBh.⁸²⁸ Though the date of the MānGS

is uncertain, it certainly belongs to the “older half” of the extant Gṛhyasūtras.⁸²⁹

If  the Sandhyā prescription is not an addition from a later time, or a different ritual milieu or context – a possibility that I would not rule out completely –

gāyatrī  in the Sūtra probably refers to the meter, and we may infer that this is also the case for the MNārU. 

If this is correct, it means that the meter in these passages appears as a goddess. While reification and personification of meters is very common in Vedic literature,⁸³⁰ in the context of the Sandhyā, this is somewhat unexpected. To my knowledge, the gāyatrī  meter was never deified and worshipped in this way before. Like other meters, it was occasionally identified with Vāc, “Speech,” who was among the most prominent female deities in the Vedic religion.⁸³¹ In several Vedic texts, the meter assumes the form of an eagle or falcon who flies to heaven in order to fetch Soma;⁸³² the same story, however, is also told of other meters. 

I am not aware that the idea of an avian Gāyatrī was continued in post-Vedic 824 See above pp. 120–121.

texts; in the context of the deification of the GM, in any case, it did not play any role at all.⁸³³ It therefore remains unclear how exactly we should envision the goddess Gāyatrī in the first recension of the MNārU and in the MānGS. 

In any case, neither of the two passages indicates that the GM played a particular role as a goddess – as opposed to several versions of the Sandhyā

ritual in later times, where the GM itself \(or, rather, herself\) is even visualized. 

If it was intended at all, the “production of the divinity”⁸³⁴ of the GM itself may have been merely a by-product: the mantra could be thought of as a goddess inasmuch as it is a manifestation of the deified gāyatrī  meter. The deification of the GM, therefore, was perhaps on its way, but nevertheless not yet fully developed when the MNārU and the MānGS were composed \(i.e., in the centuries around the turn of the millennium; a more precise dating will not be attempted here\). 

With the later additions to the Gāyatrī passage, on the other hand, there remains little doubt that the mantra itself became a goddess in the proper sense of the word. The originally ambiguous formulation here provided the basis for unequivocal deification. Already in the Āth, the invocation of the Gāyatrī is complemented by that of Sāvitrī and Sarasvatī, which resulted in the triad Gāyatrī–

Sāvitrī–Sarasvatī known from medieval texts.⁸³⁵

In a line inserted only in the later Ān recension, she is called Sarasvatī as well. In the same line, she is also called sandhyāvidyā. The meaning of this term hinges on the meaning of the word vidyā. Either it simply means “knowledge,” 

in which cases the goddess would be the “one who possesses the knowledge of the Sandhyā,” that is, she knows how the ritual is done, etc.⁸³⁶ \(which might very well be said of Sarasvatī\); or, alternatively, and perhaps more likely, the goddess 833 Mention may, however, be made of a particular passage in the MBh, where the gāyatrī  meter appears as a girl in heaven. In MBh XIII 137.18, Bhīṣma tells a story about a Kṣatriya called Arjuna Kārtavīrya, who, due to three boons obtained from a Ṛṣi, has become very powerful. Blinded by his prowess, he flew to heaven with his chariot, where he boasted that he was the most powerful being. Suddenly, he heard a bodiless voice: “You fool, do you not recognize that a Brahmin is better than a Kṣatriya? It is together with the Brahmin that a Kṣatriya protects the creatures\!” \(MBh XIII 137.12: na tvaṃ mūḍha vijānīṣe brāhmaṇaṃ kṣatriyād varam / sahito brāhmaṇeneha kṣatriyo rakṣati prajāḥ //\). 

At first, it is not clear to whom this voice belongs. But when Arjuna argues that the Kṣatriyas are superior to the Brahmins, he in passing also reveals the identity of the speaker by saying: “What this girl, gāyatrī, said in heaven is untrue\!” \(MBh XIII 137.18ab: kathitaṃ hy anayāsatyaṃ gāyatryā kanyayā divi\). Continuing his speech, he eventually drives the “night-walking” \(? niśācarī \[XIII 137.21\]\) being away. In the following, the god Vāyu \(Wind\) appears and tells Arjuna many stories, ultimately convincing him that Brahmins are superior. The passage must be understood against the background that the Brahmins and the gāyatrī  meter are strongly associated with each other; the meter personifies the voice of the Brahmins, as it were. Significantly, however, she is not described as a bird.

chapteR 6 ∙ peRsonification, divinization, deification ∙ 193

is  the vidyā  herself: at some point, vidyā  acquired the additional meaning of

“mantra” or “spell.”⁸³⁷ In this case, the text would state that the goddess actually is  the mantra of the Sandhyā, and while several mantras are used in this ritual, the GM no doubt qualifies best as the  Sandhyā mantra. In this case, the mantra would be a “manifestation” of Sarasvatī. 

The Ān, however, not only portrays the mantra as a goddess, it also makes the mantra absorb the meter by using the word gāyatrī  for both. A self-contained paragraph \( gāyatriyā gāyatrī chando-… “the meter of the Gāyatrī is the gāyatrī…”\), which is characterized by an almost complete lack of accentuation, interrupts the invocation by describing the properties of the GM \(which it also calls by that name\), adding further that its meter is the gāyatrī. The mantra here appears as an anthropomorphic \(or rather, “super-anthropomorphic”\) goddess, belonging to the gotra  of Sāṅkhyāyana, having breaths and five heads. 

The aṅga s of the mantra deity are mentioned as well, which gives the insertion a Tantric tinge. The paragraph concludes by stating that the application of the mantra is in the Upanayana, and by doing so it completely intertwines the text with its deification, making no distinction whatsoever between them. While the mantra is thus clearly deified, the meter no longer plays any significant role. 

A general assessment of the development of the Gāyatrī passage will be undertaken in the conclusion, and we will also return to the paragraph just discussed in Chapter 8.⁸³⁸ Before that, we have to deal with the last and most likely youngest addition to the text, the vedamātṛ  verse also found in the AV. 

As we will see in the following section, this verse continues to deify the mantra rather than the meter. 

**2.2 The vedamātṛ ****verse**

The vedamātṛ  verse is not only given in full at the end of one version of the MNārU, but also in the Śaunaka recension of the AV. The verse has several variant readings and appears to be a later addition to both texts. In the AV, it is the second-last piece of kāṇḍa  XIX, a relatively late collection of hymns of varying length. It is preceded and followed by other short hymns, mostly prayers for long life. While the verse also asks for āyus, a “long lifespan” –

among several other things – it clearly does not form a textually coherent whole with the surrounding hymns; in the Paippalāda recension \(AVP\), it is missing altogether. In the case of the MNārU, too, it is only given in the Ān recension. 

837 Cf. MBh XIV 44.5, see above p. 73. In Tantric contexts, vidyā s are female mantra deities, whereas mantra s are male deities \(Padoux 2011: 2, n. 4 \[see p. 123\] and 13, n. 3 \[see p. 

126\]\). 

838 See below pp. 249–252.

The verse is special insofar as it is barely intelligible as it is, neither in the available editions of the MNārU, nor in the AV, where several manuscript variants are recorded in the editions. For this reason I will first give a comparison of the two versions, including the variants found in the editions of the AV

available to me:

**Table 19: **The vedamātṛ  verse in the AV/MNārUĀn With regard to form, we observe that the first and last pāda  are more or less triṣṭubh  lines; in the MNārUĀn, the same is true of pāda  b. pāda  c, on the other hand, is hypermetric and barely conforms to the rules of a triṣṭubh \(with the MNārUĀn version being a bit less excessive\). It is likely that the original verse was already unmetrical;⁸⁴³ at least the metrical structure here is only of limited help in reconstructing the potential original wording. 

What we also gather from this overview is that many of its variant readings are probably the result of scribal misreadings and re-readings as well as typographical errors \(in the later, printed editions\): ā  and o  are very similar in Devanāgarī, as are ā\( ṃ\) and ī\( ṃ\) as well as °ānām  and °ātā. **stuto ** in the MNārU, for instance, is probably simply a scribal error for **stutā**. Assuming that **veda-**

**mātā́ ** is original, the variant vándamānā  in the old edition of the AV is probably 839 Tr. Whitney 1905: 1008: “Praised by me \[is\] the boon-giving Veda-mother. Let them urge on the soma-hymn of the twice-born. Having given to me life-time, breath, progeny, cattle, fame, property, Vedic splendor, go ye to the brahma-world.” Square brackets by the translator. 

840 Cf. also C: 915.16–17 \(no real variants are given\). Tr. Varenne 1960/I: 85: “Je l’ai louée, \(le déesse\) qui exauce les désirs, la mère du Veda, la deux-fois née qui stimule \(nos énergies\) dans \(le feu\) purificateur\! Après m’avoir donné longue durée de vie sur la terre, richesses, gloire brâhmaṇique, qu’elle s’en retourne, \(la déesse\) au monde du bráhman.” 

841 The manuscripts “accent vedamātā  in several different ways” Whitney 1905: 1008; see Pâṇḍurang 1898/IV: 549. Roth & Whitney 1856: 390 vándamānā. 

842 Other AV manuscripts also read paśúṃ-; see Pâṇḍurang 1898/IV: 549 and Whitney 1905: 1008.

the product of a copyist as well. The same is probably true of paśūn/ paśúṃ-  and pāvamānī\( ṃ\)/ pavane. 

The form **pracodáyantām **\(AV; alternating with **pracodayantī ** in the MNārUĀn\) poses a more serious problem. The reading pracodáyaṃtām  is supported by almost all manuscripts as given in Pâṇḍurang’s edition.⁸⁴⁴ Commenting on the AV, Sāyaṇa, too, \(apparently\) gives pracodáyantām  and glosses it with prerayatu “she shall set in motion” and ⁺ prayacchatu “she shall give,” stating “a full lifespan” etc. to be the object.⁸⁴⁵ In contrast, Whitney took pāvamānī́m  to be the object. However, considering that the verb prá\+ cud  in the causative is generally not used in the Ātmanepada, it is unlikely that the original verse had pracodáyantām, a finite verb in the pluralis majestaticus  with the vedamātā  as the subject. The combination of these two irregular features is highly improbable. As I \(unlike Sāyaṇa or Whitney\) cannot see how the text should be understood with the form pracodáyantām, for the time being I will assume the form pracodayantī, which is found in the MNārUĀn, is appropriate. 

**pavane **\(MNārUĀn; alternating with **pāvamānī́ ** in the AV\) means either

“in a purifying instrument,” like a “sieve” or a “strainer,” or “two purifying instruments.” Again, it is unclear how either of these forms should be connected to the rest of the sentence. pāvamānī́ “purifying” \(AV\) does not fit into the metrical structure, but would have to be understood as a participle qualifying the vedamātṛ \(similar to the assumed pracodáyantī\). The accusative pāvamānī́m, on the other hand, could refer to one of the so-called pāvamānī s, Soma hymns especially from book IX of the ṚV. Considering that the GM is often recited as a means of purification,⁸⁴⁶ however, I believe it is more likely that the Mother of the Vedas is the “purifier of the twice-born” – for two reasons. First, I would suggest that it was the adjective p **\( \)**

ā́vanī  from which both pāvamānī́  and

pavane  were derived, as it would be metrically and also semantically appropriate.⁸⁴⁷ Second, in contrast to dvija  and dvijāti, the word **dvijāta **\(MNārUĀn\) is rare, and it is difficult to see why the GM should be called a twice-born herself. 

The form **dvijānām ** is, therefore, more plausible. 

844 Pâṇḍurang 1898/IV: 549; only one reads pracodáyatām. Possibly following Pâṇḍurang, Whitney \(1905: 1008\) preferred prá codayantām, even though “the manuscripts accent pracodáyantām.” If it were the verb of a main clause in a sentence strictly following the rules of Vedic grammar, only prácodayantāṃ  would be correct. However, it is more likely that the original text was, in fact, incorrect: as the modified Gāyatrīs in the MaitrS show, the accent of pracodáyāt  was “frozen,” and the same was probably true of its derivatives. 

Cf. also n. 331 on p. 80 above and n. 760 on p. 179 above.

196 ∙ paRt ii ∙ the motheR of the vedas

The number of objects of desire in pāda  c \( **āyuḥ... **\) is uncertain: is the shorter list of the MNārUĀn a corruption of the AV list, or is the AV list a modification and extension of the MNārUĀn list? This is difficult to decide; however, if we assume that growth is more probable than reduction and consider that pṛthivyām  is the lectio difficilior, the latter may be more likely. 

On the passage containing the opaque form **prajātum **\(MNārU; alternating with **vrajata ** in the AV\) in pāda  d, Varenne remarks: It has only one obscurity: the barbarism prajātum, which we have corrected not with the imperative 2nd plural vrajata, but with the 3rd singular vrajatu. Indeed, if the form vrajata, which is so limpid, had been used by the authors of the Upaniṣad, it is hard to see how it could have been corrupted in this way, whereas vrajata/ prajātum  are, phonetically and graphically, very close.⁸⁴⁸

Another possibility would be the form avrajata, “she went,” which would fit into the context of the MNārUĀn. Considering the beginning of the MNārUĀn passage \( āyātu varadā…\), however, an imperative vrajatu  may be more likely. 

On the basis of these considerations, I propose the following restoration which, as must be emphasized again, is only tentative \(I have used here the correct Vedic accents\):

**The restored vedamātṛ ****verse**

\* stutā́ máyā varadā́ vedamātā́

Having given me long life on earth \(/ vital force, progeny, cattle, fame\), wealth, \[and\] brahmavarcasa,⁸⁴⁹

she shall go to the world of brahman/Brahmā. 

As already mentioned, in terms of language this verse is clearly not Vedic, even though its inclusion in the AV \(with its more or less correct accentuation found in the manuscripts of this text\) could easily suggest that. Probably the most 848 Translation of Varenne 1960/II: 23: “Il ne présente qu’une seule obscurité: la barbarisme prajatum \[sic\] que nous avons corrigé non par l’imperatif 2ᵉ pluriel vrajata  mais par la 3ᵉ singulier vrajatu. En effet, si la forme vrajata, si limpide, avait été utilisée par les au-teurs de l’Up., on voit mal comment elle aurait pu se corrompre de cette façon, alors que vrajata/prajatum  sont, phonétiquement et graphiquement, très proches.”

conspicuous indicator of its age is the mention of the word dvija, a term which, according to Olivelle, is “absent in the entire Vedic corpus, including the Upaniṣads.”⁸⁵⁰ Lubin pointed out that this term only became established in its classical meaning when the so-called “Āśrama System”⁸⁵¹ was devised.⁸⁵² The first text to use the word dvijāti  for an initiated person is the Gautama-Dharmasūtra \(GautDhS\), probably composed in the late second to early first century bce; the first one to use dvija  is the BaudhDhS, composed around the beginning of the Common Era.⁸⁵³ There is no indication that the vedamātṛ  verse is earlier than the BaudhDhS; indeed it could be much younger. 

In fact, it is only found in the latest \(as of now, undated\) recension of the MNārU, where it blends in well with the Gāyatrī passage discussed above: The passage, recited in the Sandhyā, begins by invoking Gāyatrī \(by which, probably, only the deified meter was originally meant\): āyātu varadā … chandasāṃ

mātā. The vedamātṛ  verse, in turn, sends her back again: vedamātā … vrajatu brahmalokam. In this way, the text comes full circle. Considering that both versions are ultimately equally corrupt, I hypothesize that the MNārU was the source of the AV – or rather, that the Sandhyā ritual performed by the transmitters of the former influenced the Sandhyā of the transmitters of the latter.⁸⁵⁴

As I will discuss again below, not only the vedamātṛ  verse, but also the verses beginning with āyātu varadā  and, respectively, with uttame śikhare, were used in other \(likely somewhat later\) versions of the Sandhyā ritual.⁸⁵⁵ How exactly the vedamātṛ  verse may have become part of the AV will need to be examined more closely elsewhere. What is most important for the present discussion is that it is by no means ancient, but rather belongs to the first millennium ce –

and therefore does not provide evidence for an early  deification of the mantra. 

**Conclusion**

The sources analyzed in this chapter demonstrate how, parallel to its rise as a mantra, the GM was also personified, and, following a certain delay, even deified \(see Figure 6 below\). The earliest evidence for the beginning of this development is to be found in the JaimUB, which, by and large, was composed before 400 bce. 

In a late portion of this text, the sāvitrī  is portrayed as the partner of Savitṛ. The 850 Olivelle 2012a: 124, see especially n. 17. 

851 See Olivelle 1993 and 2019b. 

852 Lubin 2005: 87–88; cf. Lubin 2020: 42–43. 

853 Cf. also above pp. 142–146. 

854 The verse is found in the Sandhyā prescription of the AVPar \(XLI 3.2\), which also includes the recitation of the GM – unlike the AV itself. 

855 See below pp. 248–249.

apparent equivalence of the two spouses might easily suggest that while besides being a mantra, the sāvitrī  is also a goddess in the same sense as Savitṛ is a god. 

As we have seen, however, there are many indications that the extent of the deification of the sāvitrī  was still very limited at this stage. In fact, the JaimUB

and the GopB, which in this case is based on the JaimUB, only seem to play with the fact that the name of this verse, sāvitrī, is of the feminine grammatical gender. 

While the technique of partnering a mantra with the deity it addresses is certainly creative, the JaimUB basically exemplifies a well-known aspect of the Vedic religion: everything that has a name can be personified, at least ad-hoc and temporarily.⁸⁵⁶ As with many other abstract beings, this also happened – in this case, for the very first time – with one of the few mantras that received a proper name. It is thus more appropriate to speak of a personified mantra rather than a proper deification or a “mantra goddess,” even though the mantra is, by virtue of being connected with Savitṛ, a divinity of sorts. The motive behind the creation of the passage was, in my view, to create a mythic or etiological explanation for the efficacy of the GM. With this agenda, the JaimUB is completely in line with other Brāhmaṇas, whose purpose is to explain why and how the Vedic rituals and the mantras used in them work.⁸⁵⁷

Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that the JaimUB provided the perfect basis for further speculation concerning the divine nature of the GM. In the Atharvavedic GopB, which is certainly several centuries younger than the JaimUB \(although as of yet, there have been no attempts to date it\) almost the entire text of the JaimUB has been reused. Not only do Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  again appear as a couple, but they are even the “two wombs” \( dve yonī\) of the brahmacārin  too – his parents, as it were. As several parallel passages from the Dharmasūtras and the MBh show, conceiving of the GM as the mother of the initiate – but not necessarily as a goddess – must have been quite common in the centuries around the turn of the millennium.⁸⁵⁸ Thus, the personification was further developed, and, we may speculate, was also felt to be more vivid, and perhaps even more “real” than a fictional personification.⁸⁵⁹ The SāvU, a much more recent text that we have only discussed in passing, illustrates that later redactors easily understood texts like the JaimUB as referring to a goddess. 

In a passage from the MNārU that contains the text to be used in the Sandhyā, we can observe how the mantra goddess emerged in yet another way. In 856 Cf. Elizarenkova 1995: 103. Cf. also Gonda 1963a: 286: “It is small wonder that the Sāvitrī

like many other important concepts in Indian thought could be represented as a person.”

858 Savitṛ, in contrast, no longer played any role at all. This development was not only a consequence of the fact that the teacher is the more obvious choice for the initiate’s father, but probably also reflects Savitṛ’s diminished role in Hinduism; see above p. 46.

the earliest recension of this text, the Dr, a goddess called Gāyatrī is invoked as the “mother of the meters.” The text of the GM has also to be recited but is not patently identified with the goddess called upon at the text’s beginning. A parallel passage from the MānGS buttresses the interpretation that at first only the meter was deified. Already in the Āth, however, this situation changes: not only is the goddess Gāyatrī invoked, but also Sāvitrī and Sarasvatī. Lastly, the late Ān even calls the mantra itself “Gāyatrī,” blurring every distinction between the meter and the mantra. 

It is also in this youngest recension of the MNārU that the term vedamātṛ  is introduced into the text. As I show in Chapter 8, in non-Vedic literature this term is first found in the MBh.⁸⁶⁰ Its comparatively young age as an addition at the end of a passage in a text \(the MNārU\) that is itself a later addition to a late⁸⁶¹ Vedic text \(the TaittĀ\) might not be surprising – if it were not also found in the AV. As I have argued, it is very well possible that this by and large ancient text was only the second home of the vedamātṛ  verse. In the AV, the verse is not connected to its surrounding text. In the MNārU, in contrast, it fits in very well: with the vedamātṛ  verse, the mother of the meters \(the Gāyatrī\) invited at the beginning is dismissed at the conclusion of the ritual sequence. That she is called the Mother of the Vedas indicates that the gāyatrī  meter and the GM

were both understood as aspects of a single goddess. 

On the basis of these observations, it is possible to draw some initial, general conclusions about the deification of the GM: First, the texts show that the GM was not “appointed” goddess from one day to the next, but that its deification came about gradually. Second, this process was not unidirectional, nor did it happen in all traditions at the same time: while one may detect some sort of development between the Sāmavedic JaimUB, the Atharvavedic GopB, and roughly contemporaneous texts \(especially with regard to personification\), the MānGS and, at first, the MNārU too only deified the meter. Third, the precursors were of various kinds: As the partner of Savitṛ, the GM was personified and divinized to some extent, but not \(yet\) established as a full-fledged deification. 

As the “mother of the initiate,” it was not actually deified either; its quality as a personal being, however, was possibly felt to be more vivid and real than in the JaimUB.

**Figure 6: **The deification of the GM as reflected in textual developments The early texts thus show that divinization could be restricted to specific contexts and that personification was not necessarily more than a metaphor, or a case of “personification characterization.”⁸⁶² In some cases, however, such a literary device was evidently also understood literally at some point. This is reflected by the adaptations of texts such as the JaimUB and the MNārU: both of them were augmented with passages that clearly depict the mantra as an anthropomorphic goddess \(in the case of the JaimUB, this resulted in the SāvU\); the vedamātṛ  verse was even included in the AV. Later recipients of the texts, therefore, seem to have had little difficulty in interpreting them as texts concerned with a deified mantra. As we will see in the next chapter, the emergence of this understanding was facilitated by another, more or less simultaneous process.
