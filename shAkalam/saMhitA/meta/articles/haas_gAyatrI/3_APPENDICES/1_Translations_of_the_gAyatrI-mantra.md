title = "1 Translations of the Gāyatrī-Mantra"

+++


This appendix lists all scholarly and complete translations of the Gāyatrī-Mantra into European languages that I came across during my research.¹⁰⁹⁷

\(Many more, much less accurate translations or paraphrases exist, but are not included here.\) I call a translation “scholarly” if it is oriented around the original wording and is done by someone who in my \(admittedly subjective\) judgment has learned Vedic or Sanskrit beyond the level of a mere superficial acquaintance. Both due to their great number and my own language skills, English and German translations predominate. It has to emphasized, therefore, that this list is not  the result of a systematic search for translations. 

The earliest known paraphrase in a non-Indo-Aryan language, Persian, is that by the Mughal prince Dara Shukoh \(1615–59\). In his Sirr-i Akbar, there is an echo of a passage from the MaitrU, in which the GM is explained.¹⁰⁹⁸

Those who are well-read in the Vedas have said: He should meditate on the sun in such a way as to visualize it within himself. Those who are well-read in the Vedas have also said this: The shine of the mind that we have found is an image of this one. You should say: O Sun, give us the shine of the mind from your light\!¹⁰⁹⁹

It is the last sentence that is meant to reflect the content of the GM; however, it cannot be called a translation. 

According to Theodor Benfey, the GM was first translated into a European language by Manuel da Assomcoon \(= Manoel/Manuel da Assumpçam/

Assumpção\), a Portuguese missionary who worked in Bengal in the eighteenth century; Benfey’s statement, however, is probably the result of a misunder-1097 The possible meanings of the GM are discussed in Chapter 1. 

1098 For a partial translation of this passage, see above pp. 50–52. 

1099 Ki bed-xwānān cunín gufta and: Va ba āftāb cunín maśghuli kunad ki o rā ba tasavvur-i xwad darāvarad. Va bed-xwānān cunín gufta and ki rauśani-yi ’aql ki mā yāfta em, az hamin tasavvur ast, bāyad ki bigoyed ki “Ai āftāb, mā rā ham az nūr-i xwad rauśani-yi ’aql bidahed\!”  Sirr-i Akbar: 248 \(§7\). I would like to thank Stephan Popp and Svevo D’Onfofrio for transcribing and translating this passage \(personal communication, January 15 and 16, 2023\). 

276 ∙ gāyatRī: mantRa and motheR of the vedas standing.¹¹⁰⁰ The first published and widely received “translation” \(which is still more of a paraphrase supplemented by interpretative glosses\) of the GM is in fact that by Sir William Jones from 1799:

LET us adore the supremacy of that  divine sun, the godhead who illuminates all, who recreates all, from whom all proceed, to whom all must return, whom we invoke to direct our understandings aright in our progress toward his holy seat.¹¹⁰¹

After his death in 1794, four much more literal renditions were found among his notes:¹¹⁰²

“That sun’s supremacy \(or greater than the sun\), God, let us adore which may well direct.” 

“That Light far greater than the sun, 

The light of God, let us adore.” 

“Illud, sole praestantius

Lumen Dei meditemur

Intellectus qui nostros dirigat.” 

“Than you bright sun more splendid far

The light of God let us adore

Which only can our minds direct.” 

1100 Benfey \(1848: 277, n. 1\) states that the GM was “übers. \[= übersetzt, i.e., “translated”\]

zuerst von Fra Manuel da Assomcoon,” but does not specify his source. Two works by Assumpçam are known and accessible to me: a Portuguese/Bengali grammar-cum-vocabulary list \(Assumpçam 1743a\) and a catechism \(Assumpçam 1743b\). As already noted by Cannon \(1977: 186, n. 12\), in his vocabulary list Assumpçam \(1743a: 126\) translates the word “Gaitri” as “Origem da ley,” \(i.e., “source of law”\), and on p. 575 provides a transcription of what he there calls the “GATRI DOS BRAMENES”: “Ongbhur bhoboxó, tothoxobitur bhoroniong bhorg de boxio dhimohi o ono prosso doiat.”” Neither in this work nor in the catechism, however, is there a translation \(in the latter case this is of course hardly surprising\). The most plausible explanation is that Assumpçam never translated the GM and Benfey simply misunderstood Jones’s statement that “the original Gayatri, or holiest verse in the Veda, has already been published, though very incorrectly, by Fra Manuel da Assomcaon” \(Teignmouth 1980 \[¹1799\]: 365 and 1799: 415; note that Benfey not only cites Jones, but, like him, also uses the anglicized spelling “Manuel” 

instead of “Manoel”\). Had Jones been aware of an earlier translation \(and not just publication\), he most likely would have mentioned this. 

1101 Teignmouth 1980 \[¹1799\]: 367. Jones himself must have been aware that this is not a direct translation; cf. n. 1102. See also generally Cannon 1977; cf. Johnson 2011: 56–57. 

1102 See Martinengo-Cesaresco 1902: 100–101. Martinengo-Cesaresco \(p. 100\) also quotes another rendition of Jones, which he himself apparently called “paraphrase or tica”: “Let us meditate with adoration on the supreme essence of the Divine Sun which illuminates all, recreates all, from which all proceed, to which all must return, and which we invoke to direct our understanding aright in our progress to his holy seats.”

Parts of the GM also found their way to Europe in Anquetil Duperron’s translation of Dara Shukoh’s text echoing the MaitrU \(“Oupnek’hat Mitri”\), first published in 1801:

Quicunque vult quòd illum âtma obtineat, cum medio ejus \(solis\) obtinebit: quòd Beid khanan \(τᾶ Beid lectores\) hoc modo dixerunt: et cum sole \(soli\) maschghouli \(homo\) hoc modo faciat, quòd lucem ejus cum imaginatione \(in cogitatione\) in se adducat: Beid khanan dixerunt, quòd rectitudo in-telligentiæ quam nos acquisivimus, ex illâ imaginatione es: oportet \(quòd\) dicat, quòd â sol\! nobis \(mihi\) etiam è luce propriâ \(tuâ\) lumen intellectûs des.¹¹⁰³

In the following two centuries, however, numerous direct translations were produced:¹¹⁰⁴

1104 In the following, I will give the source for the translation in round brackets if specified by the translator. Deviating somewhat from the general referencing mode, references not marked with “tr.” are to be found in the “Secondary Literature” section of the Bibliography. Several translators have also included the Vyāhṛtis in their renditions of the GM; I do not quote them here.
