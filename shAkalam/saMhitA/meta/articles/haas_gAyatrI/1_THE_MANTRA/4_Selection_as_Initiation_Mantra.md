**Introduction**

The upanáyana \(the “leading to”\), or upā́yana \(the “going to”\) as it is sometimes also called,⁴⁵⁷ takes place when a boy is led to his teacher to be initiated into the study of the Vedic texts. By undergoing this ritual, the boy enters the state called brahmacárya  and becomes a brahmacārín, that is, “someone who is engaged with \[learning\] the bráhman s \(potent Vedic formulations\).”⁴⁵⁸ Probably since the late-Vedic period – that is, sometime between 800 and 500 bce – the initiation has also included the ritual teaching of a sāvitrī  verse that authorizes the student to learn the Vedic texts.⁴⁵⁹

In Chapter 2, we encountered what are probably the earliest passages touching upon this practice, the “Upanayana passages” in the ŚatB and the BṛhĀU.⁴⁶⁰ These texts address the teaching of a sāvitrī  only in passing while pointing out the excellence of the gāyatrī  meter. The first detailed prescriptions for the entire procedure are found in the Gṛhyasūtras. The ritual act that these texts provide for is, in its basic features, always the same. As an example, here is a translation of the relevant passage from the Āpastamba-Gṛhyasūtra \(ĀpGS\): The boy, sitting facing east, seizes with his right hand the \[teacher’s\] right foot, saying: “Teach \[me\] the sāvitrī, sir\!” |8|

Then he \[i.e., the teacher\] recites:

\[1\] “That \[desirable splendor\] of the \[god\] Impeller…” |9| – pāda  for pāda, hemistich for hemistich, and then in its entirety; 

\[2\] the Vyāhṛtis, singly at the beginnings or the ends of the pāda s, likewise 457 The usage of the verbs úpa\+ nī  and úpa\+ i  is quite complex, see Kajihara 2002: 8–9 and 2016: 272, n. 1. 

458 The brahmacārín  in Vedic literature has been studied in detail by Mieko Kajihara over the last two decades. For an overview, see also Lubin 2018a.

before/after \[the beginnings/ends of\] the hemistichs, with the last one \[i.e., the last Vyāhṛti\] before/after \[the beginning/end of\] the entire verse. |11|⁴⁶¹

The Vyāhṛtis \( bhūr buvaḥ svaḥ\) are combined with the verse in the different Gṛhyasūtras in various ways \(some omit them altogether\).⁴⁶² All Sūtras, however, stipulate that the Upanayana involves the teaching of a sāvitrī  verse, for which reason the procedure later came to be called sāvitryupadeśa, the “teaching of the sāvitrī.” in most cases this sāvitrī  is the Gāyatrī-Mantra \(though not in all, as we shall see\). 

In the context of Gṛhya ritual, it is usually not too difficult to establish the connection between an act and the mantra\(s\) accompanying it.⁴⁶³ In the case of the Upanayana and the GM, however, this connection is by no means obvious. Why is the god Savitṛ invoked in this context, a god who is otherwise not associated with learning or studentship at all? Why would there be a request for bhárgas – “splendor” or “effulgence”? Besides the GM, other sāvitrī s were occasionally used as initiation mantras as well. How is their use to be explained? 

The ritual details as well as other aspects of the Upanayana have already been studied in many \(and touched upon in even more\) publications.⁴⁶⁴ The present chapter focuses on one such aspect: the employment of sāvitrī s as initiation mantras. Following on from the preceding analysis of the employment of the GM in Śrauta ritual, it shows what principles guided the creators of the Upanayana in their choice of the GM and the other initiation mantras. To this end, it not only takes into account the Gṛhyasūtras, but also the reuse of the sāvitrī s in earlier Vedic texts.⁴⁶⁵

The chapter is divided into four sections:

• **Section 1 **\(pp. 114–119\) sums up the current state of research. Several explanations of why the GM became preeminent are discussed. 

• In **Sections 2 **and **3 **\(pp. 119–128\), select passages that concern the sāvitryupadeśa  in the Upanayana are revisited. The GM is compared with 461 ĀpGS IV 11.8–12: purastāt pratyaṅṅ āsīnaḥ kumāro dakṣiṇena pāṇinā dakṣiṇaṃ pādam anvārabhyāha sāvitrīṃ bho\! anubrūhīti |8| tasmā anvāha tat savitur iti |9| paccho ’rdharcaśas tatas sarvām |10| vyāhṛtīr vihṛtāḥ pādādiṣv anteṣu vā tathārdharcayor uttamāṃ kṛt-snāyām |11|; also translated by Oldenberg, SBE  XXX: 273.

II 10.38–40, and KhādGS II 4.21–24. About half of the Gṛhyasūtras prescribe only the sāvitrī; see KāṭhGS XLI 20, ĀśvGS I 21.4–6, ŚāṅkhGS II 5.9–12, JaimGS I 1: 13.1–2, PārGS

three other verses that are occasionally mentioned as its alternatives or substitutes. A close reading of the texts shows that there was a time when the verse used in the initiation ritual was yet to be determined, and had to be selected according to certain principles. These principles are reconstructed by comparing the known verses. The sources indicate that the key feature of the verses used was that they mentioned the god Savitṛ. The second criterion was meter: while the gāyatrī  meter was almost always preferred, we also meet with triṣṭubh, jagatī, and anuṣṭubh  verses. 

• **Section 4 **\(pp. 128–133\) deals with the relationship of Gṛhya and Śrauta ritual. It shows that the sāvitrī s used in the Upanayana are among the most frequent in Śrauta ritual. The employment of these verses as initiation mantras is best explained not with reference to their literal meaning, but instead, it was the frequent use of these verses in Śrauta ritual that account for their selection. To explain this, I propose to assume a positive feedback loop \(a kind of “snowball effect”\) in ritual practice: the frequent employment of a verse often lead to its being used in other rituals and litanies.

comprehensive chronology was proposed by Gopal \(1959: 84\): first stratum: ĀśvGS, BaudhGS, MānGS, KauśS, GobhGS; second stratum: ŚāṅkhGS, BhārGS, ĀpGS, PārGS, KāṭhGS; third stratum: KhādGS, JaimGS, HirGS; fourth stratum: VārGS, VaikhGS, ĀgnGS. Another chronology has been proposed by Brucker \(1980: 58–59\) who, rely-ing entirely on secondary literature, suggests the following sequence: oldest group: BaudhGS, BhārGS, ŚāṅkhGS, ĀśvGS; middle group: ĀpGS, KāṭhGS, HirGS, VādhGS, MānGS, KauśS, JaimGS, GobhGS, KhādGS, PārGS; youngest group: VārGS, VaikhGS, ĀgnGS. This chronology, however, has been severely criticized \(see Bodewitz 1984\). Lubin \(2005: 86–87\) has suggested that Sūtras that begin their treatment of the Saṃskāras with the Upanayana \(instead of marriage\) reflect a historically late development; these include the BhārGS, HirGS, ĀgnGS, and JaimGS. Others, like the MānGS and KāṭhGS, may belong to an intermediate stage. Regarding absolute dates, it is generally assumed that the first Gṛhyasūtras pre-date the Buddha \(c. fifth century bce\) by a century or so; according to Bronkhorst \(2011: 74\), however, they were composed somewhat later, “during the centuries around the beginning of the Common Era.” Lubin \(2013\), too, surmised that, at least in the Ganges valley east of the Doab, the process of systemization of Gṛhya rituals may have taken place around the same time as the erection of Asoka’s edicts from the third century bce. In the present study, I draw conclusions based on the uncertain chronology \(relative as well as absolute\) of individual Sūtras only with extreme caution. 

I will, however, assume that they generally postdate the BṛhĀU \(which was possibly composed before or around the fifth century bce \[Olivelle 2018b\]\) and that the VaikhGS

and ĀgnGS \(which were possibly composed between the third and fourth centuries ce

\[Gonda 1977: 481\]\) are among the latest.

**1. State of research**

In secondary literature, speculations about the possible reasons for the fame of the GM and its use in the Upanayana abound. Different approaches can be distinguished, and I shall confine myself to a representative overview of the most important interpretations by modern scholars. 

The first attempt at explanation is based on the assumption that Savitṛ has always had a solar nature. For Edward W. Hopkins,⁴⁶⁶ for instance, the “most holy couplet of the Rig Veda” owed its fame to the fact that the “longed-for glory” of Savitṛ \(his bhárgas\) in later times was understood to refer to the sun. 

According to what he called its “esoteric meaning,” the GM was interpreted as an expression of a kind of “primitive pantheism” in which the sun was viewed as a kind of “All-god.”⁴⁶⁷ Similarly, Leopold von Schroeder, who was convinced that Savitṛ is a sun god,⁴⁶⁸ remarked: “Few prayers have been said here on earth as often as this one, and for this reason alone the verse does not seem unworthy of attention. For our purpose, it is a living testimony to the sun worship of the Indian Aryans which has continued over thousands of years.”⁴⁶⁹

While von Schroeder’s interpretation was already heavily criticized by Oldenberg,⁴⁷⁰ who doubted the importance of Savitṛ’s solar nature, it continued to find favor among later writers. Pandurang V. Kane, for example, tentatively speculated about the reason the GM was held in such high esteem in his treatment of the Upanayana: “Why the Gāyatrī verse \(Ṛg. III. 62. 10\) came to be famous it is difficult to say. Its fame was probably due to its grand simplicity and to its adaptability to an idealistic conception of the world as emanating from an all-pervading Intelligence.”⁴⁷¹ Therefore, “The sacred Gāyatrī \[…\] is addressed to Savitṛ \(the sun\) and may also be interpreted as a prayer to the Source and Inspirer of everything.”⁴⁷² Similar opinions were also expressed before and after Kane.⁴⁷³

However, while some texts indeed assign a more important role to this deity, Savitṛ cannot be said to have been an all-encompassing god in the Vedic or 466 Hopkins 1895: 46–50.

469 Translation of von Schroeder I: 9: “Wenige Gebete sind hier auf Erden wohl so häufig gesprochen worden wie dieses, und schon darum scheint der Vers der Beachtung nicht unwert. Hier ist er uns ein lebendiges Zeugnis der durch Jahrtausende fortgesetzten Sonnenverehrung der indischen Arier.”

\(early\) Hindu religion in general. As a matter of fact, Savitṛ had already declined in importance in the Brāhmaṇa period, where Prajāpati had a much greater claim to the status of a universal creator god.⁴⁷⁴

Others understood the GM as being above all a prayer for inspiration or

“mental power” needed by the student: in its last pāda, we read that Savitṛ is expected “to spur on our thoughts” or “to rouse forth our insights.” Oldenberg, for instance, took the last line of the GM as one of the most important factors for its use in the Upanayana \(together with the fact that it invokes Savitṛ, an important point to which I will return below\).⁴⁷⁵ Intuitively, of course, this is a very plausible explanation, for in its original context, it is indeed possible to interpret the GM as also being a prayer for inspiration. Yet, the host of other adaptive reuses of the mantra one comes across in the Gṛhya and Śrauta texts makes it questionable whether this could really be the primary reason for the choice of the GM. Furthermore, there were other sāvitrī s used in the Upanayana that do not mention inspiration at all.⁴⁷⁶

Somewhat surprisingly, the “inspirational interpretation” also exerted its influence on those who were well-acquainted with the other reuses of the verse. 

Krishna Lal \(1971\) traced the start of its career to the ŚatB, where, according to him, it was named sāvitrī  for the first time, and to the Gopatha-Brāhmaṇa \(GopB\), where it “attained a metaphysical importance.”⁴⁷⁷ At the beginning of his article, after asking why the GM was chosen and what made it so popular, he conjectured that the common use of the mantra in the Gṛhyasūtras was due to the diversity of its employment in various Śrauta rituals: One thing is very clear from the above study that the field of employment of the Sāvitrī was expanding repidly \[sic\] in the Vedic Sacrifices. It was perhaps the result of this vast field of its employment and its eminence, that all the Gṛhyasūtras, irrespective of their schools, have taken this mantra.⁴⁷⁸

As a second reason for its popularity and importance \(especially in the Upanayana\) he asserted that it was “for the most time \[…\] related to the rites concerning intellect.”⁴⁷⁹As shown above, the use of the GM in the Śrauta ritual can indeed help us understand its use in the Upanayana. It is entirely unclear, however, why the various rituals mentioned by Lal should be regarded as “rites concerning the intellect”: among them is not only the Agnihotra \(the daily fire ritual\), the Soma ritual, and the Aśvamedha \(the horse sacrifice\), but also the 474 See above p. 46. 

475 Oldenberg 1897: 480 and 1917: 64, n. 1, and p. 466; see also below p. 122. Geldner \(I: 410, n. on verse 10\) characterized it as “eine Bitte um Erleuchtung, d. h. um Inspiration.”

Puruṣamedha, the human sacrifice. In the latter ritual, the GM is used to worship Savitṛ, the “Impeller,” who is obviously expected to impel the human victims to the sacrifice.⁴⁸⁰

Another explanation concerned Savitṛ, the deity of the GM, and his connection with a certain time of the year. According to Harry Falk, it was the time of the Upākaraṇa, the “start of the term” at the beginning of the rainy season, which was decisive for the GM’s selection as an initiation mantra.⁴⁸¹ Falk highlighted the fact that the Upanayana and the Upākaraṇa originally did not take place on the same day.⁴⁸² Rather, some texts specifically prescribe an initiatory

“probation period”⁴⁸³ of up to one year between the Upanayana, the first “enrol-ment,” and the actual start of study, the Upākaraṇa. \(A short probation period, was, in any case, preferred from an early date onwards.\) While the latter regularly took place at the beginning of the rainy season⁴⁸⁴ on a day Falk calls the

“Savitṛ day,” the date of the Upanayana varied. 

According to Falk, in the early-Vedic period, the god Savitṛ was associated with the summer solstice and the beginning of the rainy season. Not only the beginning, but also the end of one’s studies was scheduled for this period. Ideally however the end was soon followed by marriage, which has much clearer links to the role of Savitṛ, who is also, recall, a god of procreation.⁴⁸⁵ As Falk pointed out, there are several similarities between the weding ceremony and the initiation to Vedic study;⁴⁸⁶ among these, in both rituals the bridegroom/teacher lets the bride/student step on a stone, takes her/his hand, and then utters the very same sāvitrī  verse.⁴⁸⁷

While this would explain Savitṛ’s presence in the wedding ceremony,⁴⁸⁸

and while the initiation ritual incorporates some elements of the wedding ritual, 480 See above p. 99.

it does not mark the beginning of a procreative life stage, but of studentship –

which is concomitant with celibacy. All of this entails a certain inconsistency, a paradox in fact: Why would a fertility god induce a period of chastity? To explain Savitṛ’s presence in the Upanayana, Falk resorted to a somewhat more speculative approach:

As brahmacārin s the students were not allowed to follow the instigations of Savitṛ to fecundity, marriage, and procreation. The Sāvitrī, given to them each year anew, must be interpreted as a germ ripening to the form of the Veda. Once the respective Veda was completely received the student left his teacher, transformed himself into a “pure” and married householder⁴⁸⁹

and, under the auspices of Savitṛ, then led a respected life which included all the possibilities this god had hitherto withheld from him.⁴⁹⁰

Although it has a certain logic, it is by no means obvious why the season in which marriages took place would also determine the choice of the deity addressed in the Upākaraṇa. Savitṛ’s connection with the rainy season is not at all sure; as I have shown elsewhere, the evidence in favor of this connection is ambiguous at best.⁴⁹¹

There is another reason why Falk’s explanation that the use of a sāvitrī

points to Savitṛ’s role as god of marital  procreation is somewhat problematic. 

While there certainly are parallels to the wedding ritual, this is only one of the “narratives” present in the Upanayana. As a result of his initiation, the student is reborn, and it is said that the teacher becomes the father of the new brahmacārin.  ⁴⁹² Thus, it is the student’s birth \(or, more precisely, his ritual and social rebirth as a dvija\) that is at the center of the occasion.⁴⁹³ The very fact that in this way the young student is introduced with a sāvitrī  into a celibate phase of his life – during which he is completely devoted to his teacher – corroborates this. 

Lastly, there is little evidence that the Upākaraṇa really influenced the Upanayana.⁴⁹⁴ Evidently a Savitṛ verse is used in all versions of the initiation ritual.⁴⁹⁵ Falk nevertheless argued that Savitṛ is not particularly important in 489 For the concept of the “householder” \( gṛhastha; literally “stay-at-home”\) in ancient South Asia, see generally Olivelle 2019a.

493 Cf. Kajihara 2002: 13 and Gonda 1980a: 378. 

494 Falk seems to suggest that the “probation period” between the arrival of the student sometime during the year and the teaching of the sāvitrī \(which, he assumes, originally only took place at the start of the term\) corresponds to the \(possible\) interval between the Upanayana and the Upākaraṇa. However, the evidence for such a development is more than scanty. 

495 See above pp. 111–112.

the Upanayana,⁴⁹⁶ as he does not figure prominently in the procedure called paridāna  or “transfer.” In this ritual procedure, which takes place before the sāvitrī  is taught, the student is put under the protection of various deities. Several Gṛhyasūtras also mention Savitṛ as one of these deities, but never as the first one.⁴⁹⁷ For Falk, the corollary of this is that Savitṛ is not important in the initiation ritual \(despite the fact that a sāvitrī  is taught\!\), but that his presence can be explained by way of the Upākaraṇa and its connection with a hypothet-ical “Savitṛ day.”⁴⁹⁸

As I have tried to show, Falk’s explanation for the use of a sāvitrī  in the initiation ritual is somewhat problematic. With regard to the aim of the present chapter, it must also be noted that his article does not attempt to provide an answer to the question of why it was the GM that was chosen and not, as in the case of the sāvitrī  used in the moment of seizing the student’s hand, a verse that has a semantically stronger connection to the accompanying action. 

The last attempt at an explanation to be mentioned here is pure coincidence. This was put forward by Frits Staal in his article “The Sound of Religion,” 

published in two parts in Numen, where, incidentally, he addressed the same question as Lal and Falk some years before and after him. His judgment on the case was devastating:

Why was this mantra picked to play such an important and auspicious role? There are hundreds of mantras in the Rigveda that say something similar. The answer to such questions is always the same: there is no answer. \[…\] For some arbitrary reason, supreme significance is attached to it.⁴⁹⁹

Staal’s laconic statement is, of course, based on his fundamental assumption that rituals and mantras are meaningless.⁵⁰⁰ Even though this theory cannot be upheld as such, the preceding chapter has demonstrated that the meaning of mantras as texts is indeed often secondary to their ritual employment. But is a reference to mere chance really the only way to explain its reuse in other texts? 

Is it really the case that the GM simply “fell from the heap like the windblown 496 “Savitṛ selbst spielt beim Upanayana keine prominente Rolle.” Falk 1988: 25. 

497 Falk 1988: 25, n. 115. 

498 It should be noted that the comparatively late Jaiminīya-Gṛhyasūtra \(JaimGS I 14; tr. 

Caland 1991: 25\) and GobhGS \(III 3.9; tr. Oldenberg, SBE  XXX: 78\) indeed mention a sāvitra ahar, or sāvitra kāla \(GobhGS III 3.13\), during which the study of the Veda is discontinued. The term sāvitra, however, refers to the nakṣatra  Hasta, whose presiding deity is Savitṛ. A Savitṛ day, therefore, recurs every month, and not just once a year at the beginning of the rainy season; cf. Weber 1862: 322.

seed,”⁵⁰¹ a seed “that falls from a blossom and is carried through the wind until it settles down somewhere”⁵⁰² – as Staal put it? 

Incidentally, Staal expressed an assumption that many of those who have thought about the GM must have had, namely that there is an incalculable amount of other Vedic mantras that could have served in the Upanayana ritual.⁵⁰³ The ṚV alone contains more than 10,500 verses, and the other Vedic Saṃhitās add even more to this already very large number. For reasons unknown, the very first verses of these collections, such as the famous agním īḷe puróhitaṃ…  of the ṚV, apparently did not qualify to be the mantra to inaugurate one’s study of the Vedic texts.⁵⁰⁴ So then, why were the GM and the other sāvitrī s chosen? 

In the following, I will try to show that the number of eligible verses is sharply reduced by the fact that the initiation mantra was supposed to be a sāvitrī, that is, a verse mentioning Savitṛ. Elaborating on a suggestion of Oldenberg, I will argue that it is the function of this god in post-Ṛgvedic rituals that was responsible for the fact that only verses mentioning him could be chosen as initiation mantras. 

**2. A sāvitrī**

As has been known for long, the word sāvitrī  did not always designate the verse ṚV III 62.10, the GM. While in later texts it \(almost\) always refers to this mantra by default, originally it could be used for any  verse mentioning Savitṛ \(one should for this reason be very careful not to automatically translate sāvitrī  with “the sāvitrī” or even “Sāvitrī”\).⁵⁰⁵ Although the author\(s\) of the ŚatB

already preferred a sāvitrī  in the gāyatrī  meter,⁵⁰⁶ it is not even entirely certain that at the time when this text was composed this sāvitrī  was already the GM. 

The same holds true for the Kaṭha-Brāhmaṇa \(KaṭhB\), a text of about the same 501 Staal 1986a: 56. 

502 Staal 1986a: 52. 

503 Cf., for instance, Apte 1939: 34: “\[The ĀśvGS\] nowhere specifies which ‘ Sāvitrī,’ \(literally a verse sacred to the god Savitṛ\) is meant although there are so many verses in the RV. 

sacred to Savitṛ.” 

504 Note, however, that they did gain some prominence in later times; see, for instance, VaikhGS VI 17 \(tr. Caland 1929: 169–170\).

age,⁵⁰⁷ which, while mentioning that the student is born together with \(not by\) a sāvitrī, is not particularly interested in the verse itself.⁵⁰⁸

Moreover, sāvitrī s in other meters were evidently used as well.⁵⁰⁹ In Chapter 2, we observed that the late-Vedic ŚatB and BṛhĀU allude to people who use a sāvitrī  in the anuṣṭubh  meter.⁵¹⁰ In these texts, this “unorthodox” practice is deprecated by the authors: according to them, one should only use a sāvitrī  in the gāyatrī  meter. Unfortunately, it is not known who the people who used the anuṣṭubh  verse were and if they really used it the same way that others used the gāyatrī sāvitrī. However, since the Brāhmaṇa mentions the anuṣṭubh sāvitrī  in the context of the Upanayana without further specifications, it seems plausible that there actually were some people who regularly used an anuṣṭubh sāvitrī  in their initiation ritual. To use a gāyatrī sāvitrī – let alone the  GM – has apparently not been the universally accepted norm since time immemorial. 

As a matter of fact, the use of a sāvitrī  in other meters than the gāyatrī  was not at all uncommon. Two other meters were quite regularly used: the triṣṭubh, the commonest meter in the ṚV, and the jagatī. Already in the \(presumably\) early Gṛhyasūtras, we observe the practice of correlating the meter of the initiation verse with the social class or Varṇa of the initiates.⁵¹¹ Two Gṛhyasūtras of the Ṛgvedins, the **ŚāṅkhGS **and the **Kauṣītaki-Gṛhyasūtra **\(**KauṣGS**\), prescribe that the teacher

teaches the Savitṛ verse within a year, within three nights, or immediately. 

He should recite a gāyatrī  to a Brahmin, a triṣṭubh  to a Kṣatriya, a jagatī  to a Vaiśya – but only a Savitṛ verse \( sāvitrīṃ tv eva\).⁵¹²

The assignment of certain meters to the social classes follows a well-known pattern that is part of a larger set of cultural, social, ritual, and cosmic correspondences, studied foremost by Brian K. Smith in a series of publications.⁵¹³

These correspondences or bandhu s, which can be established on several \(most often three\) levels between various entities, actions, and phenomena, are part of a taxonomical system that serves to organize the universe as a whole. One of the most important goals of this system is to classify society. Thus, each Varṇa \(Brahmin, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya\) can be associated with a natural element \(fire, wind, 507 Kajihara 2002: 276. 

508 See below p. 146; cf. Kajihara 2019: 4. As I will argue below, there were also other suitable gāyatrī sāvitrī s that could have been used.

sun\), a deity \(Agni, Indra/Vāyu, Sūrya/Āditya/ Viśve Devas\), a Veda \(Ṛg-, Yajur-, Sāma-\), etc.⁵¹⁴ These “horizontal” correspondences often also exhibit a “vertical” 

or hierarchical structure, in which the Brahmins, the formulators of this system, stand at the top. 

In the case of the Upanayana, it is the number of syllables of the meter that is correlated to the age at which a member of one of the three classes may be initiated. Thus, Brahmin boys should ideally undergo the Upanayana between the age of eight⁵¹⁵ and sixteen, corresponding to the eight syllables of a pāda  in the gāyatrī. For Kṣatriyas, the age range is eleven to twenty-two \(the triṣṭubh  having pāda s of eleven syllables\), and for Vaiśyas, twelve to twenty-four \(the jagatī  having pāda s of twelve syllables\).⁵¹⁶

Now let us return to the brief Gṛhyasūtra passage found in the ŚāṅkhGS

and the KauṣGS. In my view, the supplement to the text in the two Sūtras is telling: sāvitrīṃ tv eva – “but only a Savitṛ verse.” This indicates that while the meter may vary, the verse has to mention Savitṛ. In this way, the text itself stresses the most important property of the verse. It does not specify that it should be a verse that perfectly fits the context in terms of its literal meaning. 

It does not even specify the verses themselves \(as opposed to other instances, where we find unambiguous references\). Although initiation mantras were often kept secret in later times, it is more than improbable that this was the reason why the verses were not named. Rather, the verse had to be selected from the Vedic corpus. This selection was far from free, however, for the verse had to be a sāvitrī. Moreover, there can be little doubt that within a short period of time certain verses were established as standard initiation mantras. 

The insistence on a sāvitrī  may be best explained by one of Savitṛ’s most prominent ritual functions. The deity Savitṛ has two main functions: First, he is a god of procreation, fertility, and abundance. However, and even though Savitṛ did not lose this function completely, from the Brāhmaṇas onwards this role was slowly taken over by Prajāpati, the “Lord of Progeny.”⁵¹⁷ Second – and this is much more significant – he literally is the god “Impeller,” who causes all beings to move and to rest, for instance by means of the alteration of day and night.⁵¹⁸ His connection with morning and evening also suggests that he was responsible for bringing about various states of being, such as waking and sleeping. In Śrauta ritual, Savitṛ is often invoked at the beginning of a ritual or liturgy. The use of his mantras in the Śrauta litanies indeed indicates that in the 514 See, for instance, Smith 1994: 67. 

515 That is, eight years after conception. Traditionally it may have been seven from birth for Brahmins, but in order to adapt to the new standard of eight, several Gṛhyasūtras begin counting the years from conception; see Lubin 2018a: 103–104; cf. also Lubin 2005: 85–86.

course of time his power to impel remained especially important in the ritual domain.⁵¹⁹

More than a century ago, Oldenberg was to my knowledge the first to suggest that this was one of the two reasons why a sāvitrī  was chosen for the Upanayana \(the other being, as mentioned, that it is a prayer for inspiration\): It is Savitṛ’s nature as impeller which – on a side note – is responsible for the fact that if someone endeavored to learn the Veda, he first directed his prayer to this god, “who shall rouse forth our thoughts.” Hence the fame of the much celebrated Sāvitrī, the verse addressed to Savitṛ, which inaugurated the study of the Veda.⁵²⁰

As we saw in Chapter 3, however, at least in Śrauta ritual there is no indication that the GM was understood as a verse about inspiration. While one could certainly argue that the authors of Śrauta literature had little reason to allude to this aspect of the GM, it is nevertheless clear that it was most often appre-ciated merely as a perfect specimen of a sāvitrī  in the gāyatrī  meter, and little more. Only its containing the words prá “forward” and \( prá\+\) cud “to move \(forward\), to set in motion” was worth mentioning, because it could somehow be connected to Savitṛ. 

Savitṛ’s role in Śrauta ritual also fits the context of the Upanayana, for this ritual indeed signifies a great beginning – a birth even. I would argue that Savitṛ’s function as the impeller of rituals is reason enough to invoke him at the beginning of the study of the Veda. In a way, Vedic studentship itself resembles a sacrifice or worship ritual \( yajña\) and was, in fact, even designated as such in various texts.⁵²¹ Smith also highlighted this aspect: “\[The\] Upanayana inaugurates not only the study of the Veda but also the daily practice of fire sacrifice, a practice that will continue, ideally, throughout one’s life.”⁵²² In spite of the higher status that other gods like Indra or Varuṇa enjoyed, the fact that the study of the Vedas can be regarded as a sacred ritual act fully justified the use of a Savitṛ verse also in the case of the Upanayana. In my view, it is not necessary to forage for any other reason, at least as far as the choice of a sāvitrī  in general is concerned.

**3. The sāvitrī ****s**

Considering Savitṛ’s role and function in the Vedic religion, the use of a sāvitrī  is perfectly appropriate in the context of the Upanayana. The Vedic Saṃhitās, however, contain numerous verses addressed to Savitṛ and even more merely mentioning his name. How would those who were well-versed in the application of Vedic mantras have selected them? If we compare all of the sāvitrī s that were used as initiation mantras, we may be able to infer the general principles which led to their being chosen. 

In the regular Upanayana \(for an irregular Upanayana, see below\), the only sāvitrī  in the gāyatrī  meter that is known to have been used is ṚV III 62.10. As in the ŚāṅkhGS passage translated above,⁵²³ the verses of the other meters often go unmentioned.⁵²⁴ As of now, the oldest known source specifying these mantras in the context of the Upanayana is the relatively young Vārāha-Gṛhyasūtra \(VārGS

V 26\) of the Maitrāyaṇīya school of the KYV. The comparatively older Mānava-Gṛhyasūtra \(MānGS\), however, also specifies them, but only in the context of the Sandhyā.⁵²⁵ All texts give ṚV VII 45.1 as triṣṭubh  and V 81.1 as jagatī sāvitrī. 

The anuṣṭubh sāvitrī, on the other hand, is only specified in the ĀśvGS \(I 22.22–

29\). I will begin with the anuṣṭubh sāvitrī. 

**3.1 The anuṣṭubh sāvitrī**

The **ĀśvGS **\(a Ṛgvedic Gṛhyasūtra and likely one of the oldest\) prescribes an anuṣṭubh sāvitrī  for someone who needs to undergo initiation for a second time. According to Kajihara, this kind of initiation was undergone by adults who wished to study additional parts of the Veda as part of an “extracurricular training.” As such, it is particularly prominent in the Upaniṣads, which contain numerous stories about adults approaching a teacher in order to learn esoteric teachings unknown to them.⁵²⁶

The ĀśvGS only briefly describes the procedure of the additional Upanayana without mentioning its context or purpose. After the prescriptions for the regular Upanayana, the text continues to give the prescriptions for the additional Upanayana:

523 See above p. 120. 

524 ŚāṅkhGS II 5.4; KauṣGS II 3.1–5; MānGS I 22.13; PārGS II 3.3,7–10 \(tr. Oldenberg, SBE

XXIX: 307\); cf. also BaudhDhS II 9.14. 

525 MānGS I 2.1–3; see below pp. 189–190. . 

526 E.g., KauṣU I 1, IV 19; BṛhĀU II 1.14, VI 2.7; ChāndU IV 4; V 11.7, VIII 7.2; PraśnU I 1; MuṇḍU I 2.12 \(see also ŚatB X 6.1.2, XI 4.1.9, 4.2.20, 5.3.13, XIV 1.1.21; GopB I 1.32, 2.13, 3.8, 3.14\); see Kajihara 2016: 282–287.

Now for someone who has already previously approached \(a teacher to be initiated\): \[… the teacher recites\] “That \[sustenance\] of the \[god\] Impeller

\[is what\] we desire…” \[ṚV V 82.1; see below\] as the Savitṛ verse.⁵²⁷

The verse quoted by means of its first pāda  is another sāvitrī  from the **ṚV**

\(**V 82.1**\).⁵²⁸ The similarity of this verse with the GM is obvious: tát savitúr vṛṇīmahe vayáṃ devásya bhójanam /

śráéïṣṭhaṃ sarvadhā́tamaṃ túraṃ bhágasya dhīmahi //

That sustenance of the god Impeller is what we desire. 

May we obtain the Apportioner’s power, the best which best confers wholeness\!⁵²⁹

That the use of this verse is \(in accordance with its use in the irregular Upanayana\) an exception to the rule is shown by the way the ĀśvGS refers to the verse used in its prescriptions for regular Upanayana. There, the verse is only called sāvitrī, which seems to leave open which sāvitrī  is to be used.⁵³⁰

The text also mentions, however, that the teacher should recite it pāda  for pāda, hemistich for hemistich, and then finally in its entirety.⁵³¹ As Kajihara observed, the mode of recitation in three steps indicates that it is a sāvitrī  in the gāyatrī  meter; among the meters of the verses under discussion, only the gāyatrī  meter has three pāda s, and this way of teaching and reciting the verse is typical for the gāyatrī sāvitrī.⁵³² Which gāyatrī sāvitrī  is to be used, however, is not specified by the text, indicating that it is either taken for granted or irrelevant. The fact that the GM is the only gāyatrī sāvitrī  that we are certain was used strongly suggests that the former is the case and that the author of the Sūtra already viewed it as the standard sāvitrī. The special sāvitrī  in the anuṣṭubh  meter, on the other hand, has to be cited by way of its pratīka \( tat savitur vṛṇīmaha iti\). 

**3.2 The triṣṭubh sāvitrī**

The triṣṭubh sāvitrī  referred to in the VārGS and the MānGS,⁵³³ **ṚV VII 45.1**, is the first verse in a simple hymn dedicated to Savitṛ, composed by Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi:

527 athopetapūrvasya \[…\] tat savitur vṛṇīmaha iti sāvitrīm  ĀśvGS I 22.22,29. For other translations, see Oldenberg, SBE  XXIX: 193 and Kajihara 2016: 284, n. 27. 

528 The ĀśvGS also prescribes that this verse is to be recited when the teacher pours water over the student’s hand; cf. Kajihara 2014: 5, n. 11. 

529 For another translation, see n. 188 on p. 50 above. 

530 Cf. n. 503 on p. 119 above.

ā́ devó yātu savitā́ surátno, antarikṣaprā́ váhamāno áśvaiḥ /

Let god Savitar drive here, possessed of good treasure, filling the midspace, journeying with his horses, 

holding many things meant for men in his hand, bringing the world to rest and impelling it forth.⁵³⁴

It is very difficult to explain the use of this verse in the Upanayana on the basis of its meaning. The verse is an invitation for the god who is driving his chariot between heaven and earth and carrying all kinds of good things that he would bestow if he were to come. There are no specific references whatsoever to learning, studentship, or celibacy. 

**3.3 The jagatī sāvitrī**

The jagatī sāvitrī, **ṚV V 81.1**,⁵³⁵ on the other hand, begins immediately with inspiration. It is again the first verse of a hymn to Savitṛ, composed by a poet named Śyāvāśva Ātreya:

yuñjáte mána utá yuñjate dhíyo, víprā víprasya bṛható vipaścítaḥ /

ví hótrā dadhe vayunāvíd éka ín, mahī́ devásya savitúḥ páriṣṭutiḥ //

They harness the mind and they harness the insights – the inspired poets attentive to the lofty inspired poet. 

He distributes the oblations as the only one who knows the patterns. Great is the glorification of the god Impeller. 

As we can see, this verse is rather about the vípra,  the “inspired poet,” than the student or brahmacarya. The following verses of the hymn make clear that this vípra  is Savitṛ himself.⁵³⁶ Of course, it cannot be ruled out that mention of the word dhī́ \(“inspiration”\) may have been a supporting factor: after all, both this and the anuṣṭubh sāvitrī \( tát savitúr vṛṇīmahe…\) have some verbal resemblance with the GM, which may have served as a model. Moreover, based on the associative principle, one could also establish a connection between the vípra  and the student. But as I argue below, other factors were far more important.

**3.4 The selection of the sāvitrī**

The sāvitrī  in the gāyatrī  meter is often regarded as the original or “genuine”⁵³⁷

initiation mantra, leaving the existence of the other sāvitrī s in need of explanation. As mentioned, these sāvitrī s were introduced in order to mark social classes. While the Brahmins were always initiated with the GM, some of them advocated the use of sāvitrī s in other meters for the “inferior” Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas. In doing so, they attempted to clarify their own status. \(Regardless of this, the Brahmin version of the ritual continued to be used for Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas as well.\)⁵³⁸ From a Śrauta perspective, these meters were, in a way, inferior or subordinate to the shorter gāyatrī. Thus, in these cases the use of sāvitrī s set in meters other than the gāyatrī  meter was the result of a later ritual adaptation. 

This observation, however, does not explain how  the mantras were selected. Even if the gāyatrī sāvitrī  was the first one to be employed in the initiation ritual – though this is not at all certain when considering that the gāyatrī sāvitrī  is first mentioned in contrast to the anuṣṭubh sāvitrī – this would only mean that it set the standard for the choice of other mantras. There is little reason to assume that those who modified the ritual did so according to principles that were entirely different from those who created it in the first place. In other words, both the creation and the modification of the ritual were probably based on similar principles, because they were carried out by the same group of highly specialized priests. As we will see below, in the case of the Upanayana, the texts indeed provide some support for this theory. 

We will now continue by comparing the GM, the anuṣṭubh sāvitrī \(prescribed in the ĀśvGS\), the triṣṭubh sāvitrī, and the jagatī sāvitrī \(both known from the VārGS and the MānGS\). What these four verses have in common is the following:

• They are all originally from the ṚV. 

• They are the first verses of their hymns in the ṚV. Even the GM was originally the first verse of a brief hymn to Savitṛ that only later came to be part of the composite hymn ṚV III 62.⁵³⁹

• Their hymns are exclusively dedicated to Savitṛ. Even though other gods are sometimes mentioned, it is clear that they are Savitṛ hymns, both in view of their content as well as their attribution in Kātyāyana’s index of Ṛgvedic hymns, the Sarvāṇukramaṇī \(Sarv.\).

• Savitṛ is the only deity mentioned in the verse. \(The word bhága, the “Apportioner,” which is mentioned in the anuṣṭubh sāvitrī, is most probably only an epithet of Savitṛ, and can in any case be understood as such.\)⁵⁴⁰

• Excepting the mention of dhī́  in the gāyatrī  and jagatī sāvitrī, the verses hardly address the elements or topics central to the initiation ritual \(studentship, celibacy, learning, birth or rebirth, initiation itself\). At any rate, they were not composed for this purpose, nor adapted to it. 

We must not assume that the similarities between the four verses directly represent the principles that guided their selection, for they could also be a product of chance \(as per Staal\). But if we at least accept the criterion that all initiation mantras have to be sāvitrī s, the possibility of searching the Vedic corpus for suitable candidates opens up. This was in fact done in preparation for this study. In collecting the possible candidates, however, I restricted myself to those verses that originally stem from the ṚV and directly address Savitṛ or assign a prominent position to him. Of course, a priest could also have selected a sāvitrī  that only mentions Savitṛ in passing, but I consider that somewhat unlikely. Even in later times, the sāvitrī  in the Upanayana always was a “pure” or

“full-fledged” sāvitrī.⁵⁴¹

Surprisingly, the assumption that the number of candidates must be very large does not prove true. First of all, according to the Sarv.,⁵⁴² only eight hymns are entirely dedicated to Savitṛ.⁵⁴³ Apart from these, there are another seven hymns containing verses explicitly dedicated to Savitṛ.⁵⁴⁴ According to my count, there are in sum only ninety-two verses in the ṚV matching the two criteria \( sāvitrī; Ṛgvedic verse\) mentioned above.⁵⁴⁵ Forty-five of the ninety-two sāvitrī s are in the triṣṭubh  meter; twenty are gāyatrī s; twenty-two jagatī s; and four anuṣṭubh s.⁵⁴⁶

Furthermore, of these verses, one is a paṅkti, a comparatively rare meter which, we may surmise, would never have been used in the Upanayana. The 540 See n. 158 on p. 44 above. 

541 See below p. 132.

number can thus be reduced to ninety-one. Taken together, the ninety-one eligible verses do not even comprise 1% of the ṚV. What needs to be explained now is why the four sāvitrī s presented above, which we are sure were used as initiation mantras, were chosen from among the ninety-one candidates. In order to reconstruct a possible causal chain, I propose that we consider the reuse of the sāvitrī s in Śrauta ritual. 

**4. The ritual-historical background**

It is well known that Śrauta literature largely pre-dates the Gṛhyasūtras, which inform us about domestic ritual.⁵⁴⁷ The Gṛhyasūtras often presuppose the existence of the Śrautasūtras and usually cite their verses from the Saṃhitā they belong to. This makes it a priori  likely that Śrauta ritual influenced domestic ritual, which was sometimes even thought to be “a reduced form of the Śrauta practice.”⁵⁴⁸

However, while the codification of domestic ritual in the Gṛhyasūtras is generally posterior to that of Śrauta ritual, it is clear that domestic ritual must have existed since ancient times, even if we do not know exactly in what form.⁵⁴⁹

This is perhaps especially true for the Upanayana,⁵⁵⁰ which is also mentioned in the AV and the ŚatB.⁵⁵¹ It is, therefore, not to be taken for granted that only Śrauta ritual could have influenced domestic ritual and not the other way round,⁵⁵² and it is \(at least in theory\) possible that the use of the sāvitrī s in the Upanayana somehow had an effect on the development of the Śrauta litanies.⁵⁵³

This issue cannot be completely resolved here. Nevertheless, there are some reasons that corroborate the idea that in the case of the Upanayana, Śrauta ritual was indeed primary. Even if the origins and precursors of the Gṛhya rituals remain largely in the dark, it is clear that at some point it was revised by Brahmins who were proficient in the Śrauta texts \(and, as a conse-547 Gonda 1977: 478; cf. Lubin 2005: 82–83.

549 See Smith 1986a: 79–81. 

550 Cf. Lubin 1994: 168. 

551 E.g., in AV XI 5 and ŚatB XI 5.4; see also Kajihara 2002, 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019. Dismissing the evidence from the BṛhĀU as late \(p. 151\) and ignoring the AV altogether, Bronkhorst \(2016: 140–156\) argued that the initiation ritual was in fact invented  at the time of the Gṛhyasūtras towards the final centuries before the beginning of the Common Era. For the present discussion, this theory is only of secondary relevance and will therefore not be discussed further; it should be pointed out, however, that most of the passages he discussed are concerned with irregular forms of the Upanayana; see above p. 123. 

552 As was assumed, for instance, by Apte \(1939: 15\) in his examination of the Ṛgvedic mantras in the ĀśvGS. 

553 Cf. my remarks on one form of the Śrauta Agnihotra, see above p. 102. 

chapteR 4 ∙ selection as initiation mantRa ∙ 129

quence, to a great extent in Śrauta ritual\):⁵⁵⁴ While some mantras are peculiar to Gṛhya ritual, others, like the sāvitrī s used in the Upanayana, were clearly taken from the Vedic Saṃhitās. This, of course, could only be done by specialists who knew the Śrauta texts and Śrauta ritual. Because of their training, these experts would have been likely to also draw upon “Śrauta principles” when incorporating Śrauta material into Gṛhya ritual.⁵⁵⁵

In Śrauta ritual, the sāvitrī s are most often combined with other verses than those that follow them in the Ṛksaṃhitā; moreover they are embedded in litanies that are not exclusively dedicated to Savitṛ. Evidently, the sāvitrī s here are several among many; furthermore, they are used in various rituals and cannot be associated with a single ritual purpose.⁵⁵⁶ In fact, it was very often the meter in which the verses are composed and the deity mentioned in them that were taken to be their most important characteristics. 

In some cases, we also observe these principles in other Gṛhya rituals than the Upanayana. A few examples can illustrate this. According to the ŚāṅkhGS, the GM should be recited when a mantha  or “potion” is mixed, preceded by the verse ṚV V 82.1 \( tát savitúr vṛṇīmahe…\), a very frequently used sāvitrī  in Śrauta ritual, and then followed by other formulae.⁵⁵⁷ According to the Chāndogya-Upaniṣad \(ChāndU\),⁵⁵⁸ only ṚV V 82.1 is to be recited, in between taking sips of the mixture. In an obviously related procedure described in the BṛhĀU, a combination of the pāda s of the GM, the ṚV verses I 90.6–8, and the Vyāhṛtis is to be recited, again while drinking the mixture.⁵⁵⁹ While the BṛhĀU \(which has the GM\) is for the most part somewhat earlier than the ChāndU \(which has the verse ṚV V 82.1\), this can hardly be taken as evidence that the GM was in any way primary in this context \(the later ŚāṅkhGS even places ṚV V 82.1

first\). Rather, it must have been a rather common practice across Vedic schools to use \(frequent\) gāyatrī sāvitrī s in the context of preparing or consuming a

“magically” potent mixture.⁵⁶⁰

I 90.7 – bhuvaḥ svāhā – III 62.10c – I 90.8 – svaḥ svāhā. The text then reads sarvāṃ ca sāvitrīm anvāha | sarvāś ca madhumatīr aham evedaṃ sarvaṃ bhūyāsaṃ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ

560 In the much later Kauśika-Sūtra \(KauśS I 9.7; tr. Caland 1967: 42\), it is recited together with the hymn AV I 6 \( śáṃ no devī́r…\) before and after the śāntigaṇa  in order to produce śāntyudaka  or “appeasement water”; cf. Geslani 2018: 37, 100; Gonda 1980a: 131; Bahulkar 2011: 28–29; and Sumant 2013: 140. 

130 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa

The same principle was also applied in another case: According to the Kāṭhaka-Gṛhyasūtra \(KāṭhGS XLIX\), in the ritual worship of the lunar stations \( nakṣatrayajña\), one verse is to be recited for each station. Neither the stations nor the deities associated with them are mentioned in the text; however, they can easily be inferred from the structure of the list. The lunar station Hasta, with which Savitṛ is associated, is worshipped with the GM.⁵⁶¹ In both cases, it is – just as is often the case in the Śrauta rituals – merely the deity principle that was decisive. No special role is attributed to the GM or to its meaning as a text. 

I would argue that the Śrauta principles detectable in these rituals were also applied in the case of the Upanayana. When the sāvitrī s were incorporated into this ritual, this was done by experts who were firmly anchored in a Śrauta ritual mindset. But why exactly did those specialists select the attested sāvitrī s? 

**4.1 The frequency of the sāvitrī ****s in Śrauta texts** In order to see what place the eligible sāvitrī s of the ṚV have in Śrauta ritual, I counted the mentions of the ninety-one sāvitrī s in twelve Śrauta texts.⁵⁶² This made it possible to determine the relative frequency of those verses that were cited or reused at least once. As it turns out, about half of these verses can only be found the ṚV; they are listed in footnote 563.⁵⁶³

**Table 17: **The most frequently cited/reused Ṛgvedic sāvitrī s

132 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa

This table shows that even among this small selection the GM is among the most frequent, together with V 50.1, which is the most frequent anuṣṭubh  verse, and V 81.1, the most frequent jagatī  verse. The other three verses discussed above are not far behind: V 82.1 is ranked sixth, and VII 45.1 belongs among the most frequent triṣṭubh  verses. While the counts will inevitably be different depending on the sources used, the frequent use of these verses clearly shows that they were well known among the sāvitrī s. Even if we are concerned with a rather small scale, a count of seventeen or even six is rather much compared to a count of two, one, or zero, considering that in total, twenty-two sāvitrī s were reused once or twice, while forty-eight were not reused at all. 

With regard to the supremacy of these verses in the Upanayana, some additional observations can be made. The two verses that are third and fourth in rank \(ṚV V 50.1, I 24.3\) – the “competitors” of the anuṣṭubh  and the gāyatrī sāvitrī s actually used as initiation mantras – both occur in Ṛgvedic hymns that are not exclusively dedicated to Savitṛ. In fact, V 50.1 does not even mention Savitṛ

directly, but addresses him as god “Leader” \( netṛ́\). The verse has been traditionally interpreted to be directed at Savitṛ because apparently, he is also referred to in the previous hymn of the ṚV.⁵⁶⁴ Thus, we could have already ignored it according to the principles presented above. 

A detailed study of these and the other verses could reveal the ways they have taken on their journeys through the variegated Vedic rituals and texts. For the GM, this has been done in the preceding chapter, which illustrated how this sāvitrī  repeatedly found its way into the Śrauta litanies. As that chapter also showed, achieving such results is very labor-intensive. Here it must suffice to observe that they attracted some attention in a ritual domain largely independent and for the greater part even prior to the domestic rituals to which the Upanayana belongs. 

But while we cannot investigate the other verses here, a brief note on some later developments is in order: Some of the other “prominent” sāvitrī s came to be used in the Upanayana as well. In his commentary on MānDhŚ II 38, Medhātithi \(c. tenth century ce\) prescribes ṚV I 35.2 \( ā́ kṛṣṇéna rájasā…\) as triṣṭubh  and V 81.2 \( víśvā rūpā́ṇi práti…\) as jagatī sāvitrī. In Devapāla’s commentary \(c. 

eleventh century ce\)⁵⁶⁵ on KāṭhGS XLI 20, we also find VI 71.3 \( ádabdhebhiḥ

savitaḥ…\) as jagatī sāvitrī.⁵⁶⁶ All of these verses can be found in the table above, and some of them are comparatively frequent. Thus, even more than thousand years after the Gṛhyasūtras we can see that verses were apparently chosen according to Śrauta principles. \(Needless to say that none of these verses points in any way to the Upanayana in terms of their literal meaning.\) 564 See above p. 93. 

565 See Dreyer 1986: xxx. 

566 See Caland 1925: 174–175. 

chapteR 4 ∙ selection as initiation mantRa ∙ 133

Apart from these verses, however, we also observe other developments: Brāhmaṇabala, an author belonging to the early-medieval period who also commented on the KāṭhGS, prescribes VājS XVII 74 \( tā́ṁ savitúr váreṇyasya…\) to be used as triṣṭubh sāvitrī \(and ṚV V 81.1 as jagatī\).⁵⁶⁷ This verse, which is clearly playing with the wording of the GM, is original to the VājS and cannot be found in the ṚV. Yet again, it is a sāvitrī  verse whose text has no obvious reference to the initiation ritual itself. 

But let us return to the sāvitrī s attested in the Gṛhyasūtras. Although two of them contain a casual reference to a topic relevant to the Upanayana by mentioning dhī, their salient frequency in Śrauta ritual indicates that this might only have been a supportive factor. It certainly does not explain their frequency outside the Upanayana, where a reference to inspiration would seldom be expected. 

But is it really only their frequency in Śrauta ritual that was responsible for their being incorporated into the Upanayana? Why would the textual frequency of a verse influence its use in later rituals? In order to explain the observations made above, I propose to consider the ritual practice. 

**4.2 The “snowball effect” **

How exactly the Vedic branches and schools created their litanies and collections is difficult to reconstruct.⁵⁶⁸ It certainly was an extremely complex process in which not only ritual, poetic, and aesthetic principles played a role, but also political and geographical conditions.⁵⁶⁹ In any individual case, many criteria determined the choice of a verse: the meter in which it was composed, the mention of a deity or certain words, the poet or Ṛṣi with which it was associated, its previous reuse in other contexts, and so on.⁵⁷⁰

Thus, the distribution of verses in the Vedic corpus results from an extremely large number of individual decisions. These decisions must often have been made unconsciously: after all, it is unlikely that the creators of the litanies in each and every case examined the entire Vedic canon to find the verse that best met their criteria. We have to assume a certain degree of arbitrariness. This arbitrariness, however, did not depend on chance, but was most likely influenced by factors not apparent at first sight. Apart from the manifest properties of a verse itself, there were other factors that influenced the creators of the Śrauta litanies; among them, aesthetics and frequency. 

In order to explain the general distribution of verses across the texts codifying the Vedic rituals, I assume a kind of “snowball effect.” As is known, in 567 See Caland 1925: 275. 

568 See Witzel 1997b: 285–288. 

569 For the “political” aspect in the creation of Śrauta liturgies, see Proferes 2003. 

570 See above pp. 13–18. 

134 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa

Śrauta ritual, the priests of the different Vedas work together. During their ritual activities, they often listen to the litanies of the other priests \(as well as to their own, of course\). In this process, they would hear some mantras more often than others. Even if many priests know their own mantra collections in their entirety, the more or less frequent recitation \(or singing\) of a specific verse must, presumably, leave a certain impression in their minds. The perceived importance or power of a ritual as well as its frequency possibly play a role as well. When the priests set themselves the task of creating a new litany or when foraging for a verse accompanying a ritual action, they are much more likely to pick a verse that they had already heard or recited many times in the past. 

By way of a positive feedback loop, the process of reciting and listening then builds upon itself. Like a rolling snowball that grows larger as it picks up more snow, a single mantra can pick up more of the “matter” it consists of: sound. This increases its sonic \(and mental\) presence, so to speak, and eventually leads to its being used more often than others. A similar process must, in fact, already have taken place when the Saṃhitās themselves were created.⁵⁷¹

While the snowball effect does not fully explain the complex processes that may influence the selection of mantras during the creation or modification of a ritual, it nevertheless provides additional help in understanding how Śrauta liturgies were created. As the case of the sāvitrī s in the Upanayana shows, there is indeed a correlation between the relative frequency of the sāvitrī s used in the Śrauta litanies and their employment in the Upanayana, where preference was given to verses that were comparatively well known from various Śrauta rituals. 

Nevertheless, one question remains unanswered. Why were these mantras so frequently employed in the first place? When did the snowball start rolling? At least with regard to the GM, there have been attempts to answer this question, which I will briefly address in the following. 

**4.3 The Gāyatrī-Mantra in the Ṛksaṃhitā**

There are some indications that the GM was already a special verse in the ṚV, at least to a certain degree. As Brereton observed, the position of the verse within its hymn \(ṚVIII 62\) might be significant:⁵⁷² first, the general purport of this hymn is to again promote the creation of simple hymns. Second, the GM is roughly at the center of the hymn, a “key position.” Third, the books of the ṚV

are sometimes concluded by composite hymns “that represent a ritual summing up \(in the case of R̥gveda 2.41\) or a reflection on ritual \(in R̥gveda 4.55\).”⁵⁷³ The 571 Cf. Witzel 1997b: 275: “\[S\]ome of the Ṛgvedic Mantras apparently were so well known to all of them \[i.e., the Vedic priests\] that they could be taken over into all of the four Vedic Saṃhitās; the exact process is not known so far.” 

572 See Brereton 2022: 75–76. 

573 See Brereton 2022: 76. 

chapteR 4 ∙ selection as initiation mantRa ∙ 135

hymn ṚV III 62, too, is at the end of its book and may therefore have functioned as a “climax.” Brereton further observed that the GM was probably the source of inspiration for verbally similar, but later verses in the ṚV \(V 82.1 and I 159.1,5\). 

The central or “omphalos” position of ṚV III 6.10–12 was also emphasized by Jurewicz \(2021\). According to her, the GM, “which begins the second set of three tr̥ca s, could have been seen as the climax of the poem and because of that, it could have been chosen as the anchor activating the whole hymn.”⁵⁷⁴ In her paper, she reconstructed the coherence and meaning of this hymn, which in her interpretation represents the process of cognition: one after the other, the lyrical I of the poet is identified with the various deities mentioned in the verses. 

According to Jurewicz, the objects of desire mentioned in the text, such as prizes, plenitude, etc., are to be understood metaphorically and refer to cognition and inspiration. In the climactic triplet dedicated to Savitṛ \(ṚV III 62.10–12\), this quest has come to an end, as the poets are now “driven by insight” \( dhiyéṣitā́ḥ\). 

Both Brereton and Jurewicz were cautious in their conclusions and did not claim that the GM became famous only due its position or meaning in the ṚV. Clearly, neither of these factors are sufficient to completely explain its later rise and spread. However, the GM might have been just special enough to be reused in Śrauta ritual, from where it could eventually spread to Gṛhya ritual.⁵⁷⁵

It seems impossible to trace the career of the GM further back than this. 

**Conclusion**

This chapter has argued that the GM’s employment as the primary initiation mantra of the Upanayana is not to be explained by reference to semantics. There is no indication that it was chosen because it encapsulates a kind of monotheism, henotheism, or pantheism in which the deity Savitṛ is the principal deity. 

Not even his identification with the sun seems to have played a role. The interpretation of the GM as a prayer for inspiration is not alluded to in any Śrauta or Gṛhya text. The existence of other initiation mantras that are not concerned with Upanayana-related topics corroborates the view that the meaning of its text was not a decisive factor. 

574 Jurewicz 2021: 163. 

575 Whether or not the fact that its author was Viśvāmitra, who since the Sanskrit Epics has been known for having transformed himself from a Kṣatriya into a Brahmin, had any influence on the mantra, is difficult to determine. It might have been just the other way round: Sathaye \(2015: 36\) remarked that the GM’s “popularity has undoubtedly contributed to Viśvāmitra’s own continued celebrity while other Vedic figures have faded into obscurity.” 

136 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa

To interpret the mantra as a preparation for marriage \(following studentship\) is a somewhat forced explanation, too. While there are certain similarities in both ceremonies, the teaching of a sāvitrī  is peculiar to the Upanayana. However, Falk’s underlying assumption that the most important thing about the GM was that it mentions the god Savitṛ is evidently correct. 

As we have seen in **Section 2**, this is not only the common characteristic of all initiation mantras in the Upanayana, but even emphasized in the ĀśvGS.⁵⁷⁶

The existence of various sāvitrī s has long been known, but has never been considered in explaining how the GM began to attain prominence. Due to its much more widespread use, the teaching of sāvitrī s other than the GM in the gāyatrī  meter was above all understood as a ritual adaptation: the presence of these sāvitrī s can easily be explained by their association with the three Varṇas or social classes. But it has not been recognized that they are part of a more general, implicit scheme that limited the choice of the initiation mantra. As I argued in **Section 3**, the employment of several sāvitrī s reflects the fact that there must have been a time before the Gṛhyasūtras when the verse had not yet been determined, but had to be selected according to certain principles: \(1\) explicit mention of Savitṛ; \(2\) dedication exclusively to Savitṛ; \(3\) appropriate meter; and \(4\) being the first verse in \(5\) a Ṛgvedic hymn dedicated to Savitṛ. 

Even if one only applies the first, most important principle, to the Ṛksaṃhitā \(as was done in **Section 4**\), it turns out that not even a hundred verses were eligible. A statistical analysis of the occurrences of these verses in Śrauta ritual provides some help in understanding why a few of them found their way into the Upanayana. In Śrauta ritual, which in this case presumably influenced domestic ritual \(and not the other way round\), the Upanayana sāvitrī s appear to be among the most frequently cited and reused sāvitrī s. The correlation of their frequency and their independent employment in the Upanayana can hardly be a coincidence. 

I have suggested that this development was due to a kind of snowball effect. 

Verses that are reused comparatively often are more likely to reappear in other places as well, which is the result of a process in which the repeated recitation of certain verses made an impression on the minds of the reciters. When a new mantra was sought, as in the case of the sāvitrī s, the creators or modifiers of the rituals were prone to use a mantra that they had often heard and/or recited in the past. 

By studying their frequency in Śrauta ritual, we can now observe that not only the GM, but also other sāvitrī s indeed “fell from the heap like the windblown seed.”⁵⁷⁷ We can also see, however, that there was not only one big “heap” 

of of 19,000 verses, but several; for instance, the heap of sāvitrī s. Furthermore, 576 See above pp. 123–124. 

577 Staal 1986a: 56. 

chapteR 4 ∙ selection as initiation mantRa ∙ 137

the seeds or verses that were “on top” of this heap were more likely than others to be carried away and to settle down in another place.
