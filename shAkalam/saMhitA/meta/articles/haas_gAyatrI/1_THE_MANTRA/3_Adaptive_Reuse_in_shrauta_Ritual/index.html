The Gāyatrī-Mantra had already been adaptively reused³⁴⁷ in Śrauta rituals since at least 1100 bce, when the Yajurvedic mantra texts were composed.³⁴⁸ The aim of this chapter is to show how the GM was employed in those rituals and how that employment developed over time and across the various Vedic schools.
(Domestic ritual, which certainly must have existed in one form or another when the elaborate Śrauta ceremonies were devised,³⁴⁹ is discussed in Chapters 4 and 5.) To this end, I have surveyed a great number of Vedic texts, using the mantra corpus provided by the UVC as a basis.">

  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The Gāyatrī-Mantra had already been adaptively reused³⁴⁷ in Śrauta rituals since at least 1100 bce, when the Yajurvedic mantra texts were composed.³⁴⁸ The aim of this chapter is to show how the GM was employed in those rituals and how that employment developed over time and across the various Vedic schools.</p>
<p>(Domestic ritual, which certainly must have existed in one form or another when the elaborate Śrauta ceremonies were devised,³⁴⁹ is discussed in Chapters 4 and 5.) To this end, I have surveyed a great number of Vedic texts, using the mantra corpus provided by the UVC  as a basis.</p>
<p>Up to the present day, there has been much speculation about the nature and significance of the GM, and very often this is also projected back onto its early history. Thus, the GM is sometimes said to be a particularly well-composed piece of poetry,³⁵⁰ a spiritual prayer for inspiration, or a prayer to a universal sun god.³⁵¹ This chapter shows that these readings cannot be upheld for the early history of the mantra. Rather, for the most part of its “adolescence,” the GM was primarily and rather simply known as one among many verses that are set in the gāyatrī  meter and mention Savitṛ, the god “Impeller.” As such, the GM was only one among a variety of other so-called sāvitrī s. As we will see, however, this specific verse was comparatively prominent and often employed in similar ways in Śrauta ritual across various Vedic schools.</p>
<p>The chapter consists of four sections:</p>
<p>• **Section 1 **(pp. 84–85) summarizes the current state of research.</p>
<p>347 For the distinction between simple and adaptive reuse, see n. 75 on p. 18 above.</p>
<p>348 “A rough and ready estimation of the absolute dates of the vedic texts puts the ṛgvedic compositions 1600–1200 BCE, the yajurvedic mantra  texts 1200–1100 BCE, the expository prose 1100–600 BCE, and the descriptive prose of most of the Sūtras 600–400 BCE.”</p>

<p>349 For the relationship between the Gṛhya and the Śrauta ritual, see Smith 1986a.</p>
<p>350 Prabhakar (1974: 63–66), for instance, argued that the mantra already stood out in the ṚV because of the unique combination of its components.</p>

<p>• **Section 2 **(pp. 85–103) contains my analysis of the employment of the GM</p>
<p>in Śrauta ritual. Every mention of the GM is discussed against the textual and reconstructed ritual and liturgical backgrounds. As this part is very technical, the general reader might want to jump ahead to Section 3.</p>
<p>• **Section 3 **(pp. 104–105) summarizes the results of the analysis in Section 2.</p>
<p>• **Section 4 **(pp. 106–109) discusses how the results can be contextualized within the chronological and geographical frames of the relevant texts and attempts to outline the development of the reuses of the GM.</p>
<p><strong>1. State of research</strong></p>
<p>Until very recently, the history of the GM outside and prior to its becoming a part of the Upanayana has been almost entirely ignored. While speculations concerning possible reasons for the use of the GM in the Upanayana abound, it has regularly been taken for granted that Śrauta ritual never played an important role in its development. One of the few studies exclusively devoted to the early history of the mantra is that of Krishna Lal (1971), who marshalled most (but not all) occurrences of the GM in the Saṃhitās, Brāhmaṇas, and Śrautasūtras. Lal, however, did not go any further than observing that the GM did not enjoy any special importance in most of these texts.</p>
<p>In 1988, Harry Falk published an important study of the role of Savitṛ in early-Vedic religion, in which he suggested that it was the nature of this deity that had been decisive for the employment of the GM in the Upanayana. The GM itself, however, was only marginally addressed in this paper, which was primarily concerned with the nature of Savitṛ and his manifestation in nature.³⁵²</p>
<p>Three decades later (at the same time that the present study was in the process of being written) two scholars independently turned to the beginnings of the famous mantra and studied it from different perspectives: Mieko Kajihara (2019) and Joël P. Brereton (2022).</p>
<p>In her concise and diligent study, Kajihara dealt with the questions of “how and from when a verse called Sāvitrī is related to the knowledge of the Veda”</p>
<p>and “from when the word sāvitrī́-  refers to R̥V 3.62.10 in particular.”³⁵³ After addressing these questions, however, she concentrated on the modified GM in 352 For a critical review of Falk’s theories, see Haas 2020: 155–161.</p>
<p>353 Kajihara 2019: 2.</p>
<p>chapteR 3 ∙ adaptive Reuse in śRauta Ritual ∙ 85</p>
<p>later traditions.³⁵⁴ Her article thus did not deal with the earliest  reuse of the GM.</p>
<p>No attempt was made to elucidate why and as a result of what developments the specific verse ṚV III 62.10 became the sāvitrī  as we know it.</p>
<p>Brereton, on the other hand, completely honed in on the early history of the mantra. In his paper, he followed the path the GM had taken through the Vedic texts and contexts. He discussed the verbal similarities of the GM with other verses in the ṚV (V 82.1 and I 159.1, 5), and concluded that it was probably the GM that was the source of inspiration for these other verses. However, he also noted that as “the R̥gveda shows frequent intratextualities, […] it is difficult to know just how significant the Gāyatrī was held to be.”³⁵⁵ In the remainder of the paper, Brereton turned to the employment of the GM in Śrauta ritual, discussing many of the text passages also collected in this chapter. His general conclusion was that the GM first occurs “in marked positions representing ritual transitions and beginnings” in the tradition of the Śukla-Yajurveda (ŚYV), and that it was this special function that was responsible for its employment in the Upanayana. Since the analysis presented here is more comprehensive than that found in Brereton’s study of this part of the history of the GM, his findings will be discussed at the appropriate places. The analysis presented here confirms most of his conclusions. However, by approaching the subject from a different angle, it also shows that the GM was also employed in very similar ways outside and even prior to its reuse in the ŚYV tradition.³⁵⁶</p>
<p><strong>2. Employment in Śrauta ritual</strong></p>
<p>The structure of the following analysis, which has to cope with a great amount of textual material, is determined by two different categories. The first category is the tradition and Veda to which a given text belongs, e.g., “Taittirīya (ŚYV),”</p>
<p>“Aitareya (ṚV),” etc. The second category subsumes similar or otherwise interrelated instances of a given way of employment in ritual and/or interpretation, for instance the Agnihotra or Puruṣamedha. A given combination of these categories is manifested in an “instance,” marked by a number sign # and consecutively numbered throughout the entire section. For a clearer overview, the reason why the GM is employed (“deity principle,” “metrical principle,” etc.) is indicated beside the title of the instance. In the presentation of litanies, the 354 Answering the questions of “(3) how the variations of the Sāvitrī are produced in the Vedic and the post-Vedic texts, and (4) how and why the idea of the sacred verse Sāvitrī is adopted into the religious traditions beyond the ancient Vedic religion.” Kajihara 2019: 2.</p>

<p>meter of a verse and the author to whom a verse is attributed (in the following simply: “poet”) is always given for the sake of completeness; in most cases, they are not relevant to the purposes of this study.</p>
<p>In sum, the GM is used in more than eight different ritual contexts (which will be treated in this order): in several versions of the Agnyupasthāna (#1–</p>
<p>4); in the tertial Vaiśvadeva Ritual (#5); in several Vaiśvadeva-Śastras within the context of the Soma ritual (#6–10); in the Aśvamedha (#11) and the Puruṣamedha (#12); in the Pravargya (#13); in the Prāyaṇīyeṣṭi (#14, also in the context of the Soma ritual); and in the daily Agnihotra (#15).</p>
<p>#**1–4 The Agnyupasthāna: **deity principle</p>
<p>The Agnyupasthāna is a non-obligatory adjunct of the Agnihotra and is usually only performed in the evening.³⁵⁷ It is performed after the Agnihotra and generally comprises the recitation of various litanies before the Āhavanīya and Gārhapatya fires, the so-called Agnihotrī cow (whose milk is used in the ritual), and her calf. Virtually all text passages relevant to the Agnyupasthāna were collected by Gonda (1980b) who, however, for the greater part only reproduced the information given in the sources without further analysis. Thus, it has never been investigated how the litanies of the ritual were assembled and how they evolved. As we can see below, there are some verses (**ṚV VIII 51.7 **to Indra, <strong>IV</strong></p>
<p>**9.8 **and **X 87.22 **to Agni, **I 18.1 **to Brahmaṇaspati, all of them marked bold in the following instances) which can be found in most of these litanies, among them also the GM. Together with <strong>ṚV VIII 51.7</strong>, the GM is present in all of them, and therefore, we may assume that these two as well as some of the other verses were already used in that form of the Agnyupasthāna litany from which all of the others were presumably derived.</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear whether the longer litanies were derived from a basic structure according to certain principles or whether the shorter ones resulted from a process of simplification, in which some verses were dropped (though the former appears to be more likely). In the Vājasaneyin litany, for instance, the verses of the much simpler Kauṣītaki litany are simply preceded by two groups of three verses, each directed at Brahmaṇaspati and the Ādityas, respectively. In other cases, the addition of verses seems to follow certain principles. In Āpastamba’s and Hiraṇyakeśin’s elaborate litany, the verse TaittS I 4.22.a, beginning with the words **kadā́ caná **starī́r asi (<strong>ṚV VIII 51.7</strong>), is followed by TaittS I 4.22.c, a verse that begins similarly with **kadā́ caná **práyucchasi.  The last verse of the same litany (TaittS I 4.22.p), addressing Agni, begins with <strong>pári tvā</strong>gne púraṃ vayáṃ-,  a beginning that is similar to that of the frequently reused verse to Agni, **ṚV IV 9.8 **( **pári te **dūḷábho rátho-). We also see that the deities ad-357 For references, see Hillebrandt 1897: 110 and Gonda 1980b: 8–9.</p>
<p>chapteR 3 ∙ adaptive Reuse in śRauta Ritual ∙ 87</p>
<p>dressed in the litanies follow a certain pattern: usually, but not always, Savitṛ–</p>
<p>Brahmaṇaspati–(Mitra–)Indra–Agni. The resemblances of the verses employed in the litany and their order thus suggest some kind of development that had either started with one of the extant litanies or with another (now lost) source.</p>
<p>A detailed examination of the Agnyupasthāna litanies will have to be the subject of another study. For now, it is sufficient to note that the GM is an integral part of the ritual procedure. Its selection cannot be explained by any resemblance or relation to the other verses. While the other “original” verses appear to have at least some verbal resemblance with each other (**VIII 51.7 **and **IV 9.8 **both mention the dāśús  or “worshipper”; **IV 9.8 **and **X 87.22 **both begin with pári), the GM stands apart. Its presence may simply be explained by the fact that it is a verse mentioning Savitṛ: like many other rituals,³⁵⁸ the Agnyupasthāna was originally supposed to begin with an invocation of Savitṛ, and this was done with the help of a sāvitrī  verse.</p>
<p>#<strong>1 The first Taittirīya Agnyupasthāna (KYV)</strong></p>
<p>In most Śrautasūtras of the Taittirīya tradition, the GM is prescribed as the first verse for addressing the Āhavanīya.³⁵⁹ The verses used are addressed to Savitṛ, Brahmaṇaspati, Indra, and Agni:</p>

(Determining and recording the exact relationship between Ṛgvedic verses and their cognates or variations in other Vedic texts would have gone beyond the scope of this chapter.) 362 According to the BaudhŚS, the last two verses (pos. 3–4) are said not to be directed at the Āhavanīya but are used to worship the “night” ( rātrī) and the Gārhapatya.</p>
<p>363 See n. 362.</p>
<p>88 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>The corresponding Brāhmaṇa section in the TaittS merely informs us that the GM is used prásūtyai, that is, “for impulsion” or “procreation,” alluding to the etymology (or morphology) of the word savitṛ́, and possibly also referring to the initial position within the litany.³⁶⁴ Inasmuch as this rather simple litany is already documented in this form in the earliest Taittirīya text, the TaittS, it is likely that it is older than the second, augmented Taittirīya litany, to which we will turn next.</p>
<p>#<strong>2 The augmented Taittirīya Agnyupasthāna (KYV; Āpastamba and</strong> <strong>Hiraṇyakeśin)</strong></p>
<p>In two other Śrautasūtras of the Taittirīya tradition, that of Āpastamba and Hiraṇyakeśin, the GM is the fourth of ten verses recited at the beginning of the Agnyupasthāna.³⁶⁵ The GM again initiates the sequence Savitṛ–Brahmaṇaspati–</p>
<p>Indra–Agni after three preceding verses taken from the Kaṭha-Saṃhitā (KaṭhS).</p>
<p>In comparing these prescriptions with those of the other Taittirīya texts, we observe that new verses are added to the litany, especially verses to Mitra (TaittS</p>
<p>III 4.11.p,r).³⁶⁶ Another verse to Indra, TaittS I 4.22.c, was most likely chosen because of its similarity with the preceding verse I 5.6.o.</p>

<p>In the Vājasaneyi-Saṃhitā (VājS), we find many of the verses given in the texts of the KYV.³⁶⁷ Here, however, the order of the addressed deities and their verses is different, and the litany does not start with the GM, which only occupies the penultimate position.

<p>90 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>Brereton remarked that in this litany, “the Gāyatrī functions to introduce the concluding mantra that states the sacrificer’s requests of the god,”³⁶⁸ an interpretation that could indeed be valid. It should in any case be noted that this is the only version of the Agnyupasthāna litany in which the GM does not  occupy a formally recognizable first position.</p>
<p>The corresponding passage in the ŚatB explains the use of the GM thus:</p>
<p>“Then a sāvitrī́. Verily, Savitṛ is the impeller of the gods, and thus, all desires are fulfilled for him, only when they are impelled by Savitṛ.”³⁶⁹ In terms of its content, this passage could be characterized as one of the many and typical “ad-hoc explanations” found in the Brāhmaṇas. However, it also suggests that it was the literal meaning of Savitṛ’s name that was taken to be the most prominent component of the mantra. This is corroborated by the way the ŚatB refers to it: the verse is primarily a sāvitrī́, that is, a verse mentioning Savitṛ. As the authors of the Brāhmaṇa were probably well aware, the deity principle was the determining factor in this litany (as in the following ones).</p>
<p>Michael Witzel pointed out that the VājS is probably a late-Vedic text (c.</p>
<p>eighth century bce or later), whose compilation and consolidation was perhaps inspired by the well-ordered final redaction of the ṚV, or was undertaken to emulate the Saṃhitās of the KYV.³⁷⁰ Possibly, it was even dependent on the existence of the ŚatB. Considering the age of the VājS, its Agnyupasthāna litany is probably the most recent, with the possible exception of the Kauṣītaki/Śāṅkhāyana litany.</p>
<p>#<strong>4 Kauṣītaki Agnyupasthāna (ṚV)</strong></p>

<p>The Śāṅkhāyana school is usually (but, perhaps without justification)³⁷³ associated or even identified with the Kauṣītaki school. With regard to the Agnyupasthāna, the earlier KauṣB only prescribes the recitation of the so-called Vātsapra hymn.³⁷⁴ The origin of the Agnyupasthāna litany presented in the Śāṅkhāyana-Śrautasūtra (ŚāṅkhŚS) is unknown. As its litany is the shortest and the verses contained in it are present in all of the others, we may surmise that the Śāṅkhāyana version is either very close to or even identical with the original Agnyupasthāna litany, or that it is a simplified version of the Taittirīya litany – non liquet.</p>
<p>#<strong>5 The Vaiśvadeva ritual (KYV)</strong>: deity principle; metrical principle The three rituals that are performed at the beginning of the hot season ( grīṣma), the rainy season ( varṣa), and the cold season ( hemanta), each lasting four months, are called Cāturmāsyas or Tertial Rites.³⁷⁵ The first of them is called Vaiśvadeva (not to be confused with the Vaiśvadeva-Śastra) and should be performed on the full-moon day of the months Phālguna or Caitra, that is, around the vernal equinox.³⁷⁶ In this ritual, the gods are offered oblations placed on potsherds. Savitṛ receives the third of five oblations after Agni and Soma. The two verses directed at him are found in the TaittS and the MaitrS.³⁷⁷ The entire litany comprises the following verses:</p>

<p>Here we observe that the litany is primarily structured by the order of deities addressed (two verses are dedicated to each deity) and a metrical pattern. The first verse of a pair is usually a gāyatrī, while the second one is a triṣṭubh  or a jagatī (with some exceptions). Sometimes, the two were even composed by the same poet (or at least hail from the same Ṛgvedic hymn). In the case of Savitṛ’s pair of verses, the first one, the GM, is followed by another verse from the ṚV</p>
<p>in the jagatī  meter. The content of the verses does not seem to have played any role, at least it is difficult to connect the GM with the following verse.³⁷⁸ When the creators of this litany were looking for a sāvitrī  in the gāyatrī  meter, their choice fell on the GM. The decisive factors for its inclusion in the litany were arguably that it mentions Savitṛ and is set in the gāyatrī  meter.</p>
<p>#**6–10 Vaiśvadeva-Śastra: **deity principle</p>
<p>One of the rituals dealt with in the Ṛgvedic Śrautasūtras and Brāhmaṇas is the Soma ritual. In this ritual, a litany called Vaiśvadeva-Śastra, a “Praise to All Gods,” recited by the Hotṛ, who is responsible for reciting the Ṛgvedic verses, is used in several variations.</p>
<p>In the AitB and the Āsvalāyana-Śrautasūtra (ĀśvŚS), the GM is found in four of the Vaiśvadeva-Śastras recited during the so-called Ṣaḍaha, the “Six-Day” Soma ritual. While the AitB and the ĀśvŚS often diverge from each other with regard to the verses used in the litanies, the GM (as well as of some other verses and hymns) is quite consistently employed.</p>
<p>The Ṣaḍaha has two forms, the Abhiplava and the Pṛṣṭhya; the GM is used in the litanies of the Pṛṣṭhya form. According to the AitB and the ĀśvŚS, on the 378 ṚV IV 54.3 (TaittS IV 1.11.h, MaitrS IV 10.3: 149.15): “Whatever we have done to the divine race, because of heedlessness, or scant skills, or excess of power, or our sheer human nature, o Savitar, among both the gods and the sons of Manu, impel us to be without offense here.” ácittī yác cakṛmā́ dáiviye jáne, dīnáir dákṣaiḥ prábhūtī pūruṣatvátā / devéṣu ca savitar mā́nuṣeṣu ca, tuváṃ no átra suvatād ánāgasaḥ //; tr. Jamison &amp; Brereton 2014: 639.</p>
<p>chapteR 3 ∙ adaptive Reuse in śRauta Ritual ∙ 93</p>
<p>second, fourth, and eighth days of the Pṛṣṭhya Ṣaḍaha, the GM as well as the following ṚV verse (III 62.11) are combined with ṚV V 50.1 to form a triplet. The latter verse, which begins with a reference to an anonymous deity called netṛ́,</p>
<p>“Leader,” has traditionally been interpreted as being directed at Savitṛ because he is also mentioned in the previous hymn (ṚV V 49).³⁷⁹ This verse is a rather frequently used “sāvitrī,” and is also cited in Yajurvedic texts.³⁸⁰</p>
<p>In the following, the Vaiśvadeva-Śastras for the second, fourth, and eight days are presented; the sixth day, which shows some peculiarities, will be treated after these three days. The version of the AitB is always given before the younger ĀśvŚS. As will be seen, the order of the deities addressed in the Śastras is almost invariably Savitṛ–Heaven and Earth–Ṛbhus–All Gods (Viśve Devas). Interestingly, this order can also be found in the collection of Nivids, eleven similarly structured prose texts that are inserted into particular Śastras.³⁸¹ While the pattern was thus not peculiar to the Vaiśvadeva-Śastras, the verses vary in each litany.</p>
<p>#<strong>6 Aitareya and Āśvalāyana Vaiśvadeva-Śastra, second day (ṚV)</strong> For the Vaiśvadeva-Śastra of the second day, the AitB prescribes the following verses and hymns:³⁸²</p>

<p>380 TaittS III 5.11.3; MaitrS I 2.2: 10.15, II 7.7: 82.10, II 6.5: 65.8; KaṭhS II 2.2, XVI 7, XXIII 2; ŚatB III 1.4.18, VI 6.1.21, XIII 1.8.8. See also AitB IV 8, XI 67, XXII 21; KauṣB VIII 1, XXII 5, XXVI 17.</p>
<p>381 Scheftelowitz (1919) maintained that the Nivids are the oldest Vedic prose texts. This has been relativized by Proferes (2014), who argued that while containing several archaic linguistic forms, their structure and organization presupposes the existence of the entire Ṛgvedic collection.</p>

<p>In the Kauṣītaki texts, the GM and the two verses following it in the ṚV are used in the Vaiśvadeva-Śastra of the Dvādaśāha, the “Twelve-Day” Soma ritual. The GM is recited on the fifth day and all three verses are recited on the seventh day. The KauṣB and the ŚāṅkhŚS agree much more with each other than the AitB and the ĀśvŚS, and they can usually be considered together.</p>
<p>According to the KauṣB as well as the ŚāṅkhŚS, which adds a hymn at the end, the litany of the fifth day contains the following verses:³⁹⁷</p>
<p>395 1–4: jagatī; 5: anuṣṭubh; 6: bṛhatī; 7: satobṛhatī; 8–9: anuṣṭubh; 10: gāyatrī; 11: triṣṭubh.</p>

<p>are recited by hemistichs, see ĀśvŚS VIII (= uttarārdha  II) 1.22: “From this [hymn], the verses are recited by hemistichs before the last [verse, i.e., X 62.11, and] after the fourth</p>

<p><strong>Table 15</strong></p>
<p>For this Vaiśvadeva-Śastra, several verses are explained as being “characteristic” ( rūpa) of the first day because of various words they contain (KauṣB XXVI 10). Referring to the GM, for instance, the Brāhmaṇa says the following: “‘That desirable [splendor] of the Impeller…’ is directed at Savitṛ; ‘who shall spur on /</p>
<p>move forward our thoughts’ contains [the word] ‘forward’ – verily, that which 398 The Sūtra specifies that only the first four verses should be recited.</p>
<p>399 triṣṭubh; 16–17: atijagatī; 20: ekapadā virāj.</p>
<p>400 This hymn is only prescribed by the Sūtra; cf. Caland 1953: 265.</p>
<p>401 For the seventh day, see ŚāṅkhŚS X 9.16 (tr. Caland 1953: 272) and KauṣB XXVI 10 (tr.</p>
<p>Keith 1920: 501).</p>
<p>98 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>contains ‘forward’ is the characteristic of the first day.”⁴⁰² The alliteration of pra “forward” and prathama “first” gives further emphasis to this explanation.⁴⁰³</p>
<p>#<strong>11 Vājasaneyin Aśvamedha (ŚYV)</strong>: deity principle, metrical principle, significance of the GM</p>
<p>In the Aśvamedha section of the VājS, the GM is the first of six verses addressing three different “manifestations” of Savitṛ (as explained in the Kātyāyana-Śrautasūtra [KātyŚS])⁴⁰⁴ after the consecration of the horse. Their translation is given here in full:</p>
<p>May we obtain that desirable splendor of the god Impeller, who shall spur on our thoughts! /9/.</p>
<p>I call upon the golden-palmed Impeller for help. Through divinity he is the watchman of the track. /10/⁴⁰⁵</p>
<p>We invoke the great benevolence of the attentive god, the Impeller, which brings true gifts. /11/</p>
<p>We ask for the good praise of the increaser of benevolence, for the favor of the Impeller, the mind-reading god. /12/</p>
<p>I call upon the one who bestows favors, the true lord, for joy, (I call upon) the Impeller for impulse, for the sake of the gods’ enjoyment/feast. /13/</p>
<p>We shall think upon the thought of the god Impeller, his impulse toward all the gods, with inspiration; (we shall think) upon the Apportioner. /14/⁴⁰⁶</p>
<p>All of these verses are in the gāyatrī  meter. As observed by Brereton, they were intended as a coherent composition:</p>
<p>After the first two verses of this hymn (VSM [= VājS] 22.9 and 10), the next four verses are linked by words or word segments beginning su-  or sa-, echoing the name of Savitar. They are also linked by concatenation: verse 12 repeats sumatí-  from verse 11, verse 13 repeats rātí-  from verse 402 KauṣB XXVI 10: tat savitur vareṇyam iti sāvitram | dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayād iti pravat |</p>
<p>pravad vai prathamasyāhno rūpam.</p>
<p>403 Interestingly, the Vedic as well as the English words are cognates; see EWA  II: 179.</p>
<p>404 savitṛ prasavitṛ, savitṛ āsavitṛ, and savitṛ satyaprasava; see KātyŚS XX 2.6 (tr. Ranade 1978: 535); cf. Gonda 1988: 61.</p>
<p>405 Cf. the translation of this verse by Jamison &amp; Brereton 2014: 114.</p>
<p>406 VājS XXII 9–14 (9 = GM; 10 = ṚV I 22.5): tát savitúr váreṇyaṃ bhárgo devásya dhīmahi /</p>
<p>dhíyo yó naḥ pracodáyat /9/ híraṇyapāṇim ūtáye savitā́ram úpahvaye / sá céttā devátā</p>

<p>suṣṭutíṁ sumatīvṛ́dho rātíṁ savitúr īmahe / prá devā́ya matīvíde /12/ rātíṁ sátpatiṃ</p>
<p>mahé savitā́ram úpahvaye / āsaváṃ devávītaye /13/ devásya savitúr matím āsaváṃ viśváde-vyam / dhiyā́ bhágaṃ manāmahe /14/; cf. the translation of the last verse by Brereton 2022: 79.</p>
<p>chapteR 3 ∙ adaptive Reuse in śRauta Ritual ∙ 99</p>
<p>12 (and echoes sumatí-  by sátpati-), and verse 14 repeats āsavá-  from verse 13. These formal features establish the coherence of the hymn.⁴⁰⁷</p>
<p>We also see that in the GM as well as in almost every other verse (except 13), the objects, genitive and/or dative forms, alternate with each other in patterns, for instance in verse 12: “the good praise of the increaser of benevolence – the favor of the Impeller.”</p>
<p>Apparently there was a rather strong connection between the Aśvamedha and Savitṛ, as verses to this (impelling) god had to be recited and iṣṭi s performed every day while the horse was roaming across the land. It is possible that this connection also inspired the creator of the Savitṛ hymn translated above. The deity was thus again primary. The new Savitṛ hymn was begun with two well-known sāvitrī s, followed by other verses that are only found in the VājS and are modelled on the first two. While significantly occupying the first position, the GM is nevertheless only one of two leading sāvitrī s.</p>
<p>#<strong>12 Puruṣamedha (YV)</strong>: deity principle, word principle ( prá, sū, and cud) In the Puruṣamedha, which in many respects resembles the Aśvamedha, Savitṛ</p>
<p>is invoked as the first deity on the third day of the ritual according to the VājS</p>
<p>(ŚYV) as well as the Hiraṇyakeśi-Śrautasūtra (HirŚS [KYV]).⁴⁰⁸ The GM is here used as the second of three verses accompanying oblations to the god.⁴⁰⁹ All of them are called sāvitrī s, which again illustrates that at that time, the term was not yet used as the proper name of the GM. Furthermore, the GM is not recited at the very beginning of the Puruṣamedha and is not the first mantra in the litany.⁴¹⁰ It is, however, the first metrical text to be recited on this day.</p>
<p>The two verses surrounding the GM, which are recited when the human sacrifices are brought to the place of the sacrifice, are the following: God Impeller, impel the sacrifice, impel the lord of the sacrifice to the share! The heavenly Gandharva, the enlightener of the banner, shall enlighten our intention, the Lord of Speech shall sweeten our prize! /1/</p>
<p>May we obtain that desirable splendor of the god Impeller, who shall spur on our thoughts! /2/</p>
<p>All difficulties impel away, god Impeller. Impel to us here what is benefi-cial. /3/⁴¹¹</p>

<p>100 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>The ŚatB only briefly comments on these three verses: “thus he [i.e., the officiant] pleases the Impeller, and pleased, he [i.e., the Impeller] impels these men⁴¹² forward to him [i.e., the officiant], impelled by him [i.e., the Impeller], he seizes them.”⁴¹³</p>
<p>The mantras used here are supposed to propitiate Savitṛ, who is obviously expected to impel the human victims to the officiant who is about to sacrifice them. Understandably, Gonda remarked that the recitation of the GM in this context, which for him “essentially is a prayer for spiritual illumination,”⁴¹⁴ is</p>
<p>“an improper use of this prayer.”⁴¹⁵ As has been shown in Chapter 1 – and as one may already conclude from the material presented so far – there is little reason to think that the practitioners of Śrauta ritual understood it as such a prayer at all. The ritual context, the combination with the other verses, and the comment of the Brāhmaṇa all show that the decisive factor for their inclusion was the fact that they contain the word prá “forward” along with a form of sū “to impel” or, in the case of the GM, with cud “to set in motion.”</p>
<p>#<strong>13 Vājasaneyin Pravargya (ŚYV)</strong>: Upanayana?</p>
<p>Originally, the Pravargya was a simple ritual in which milk was offered to the Aśvins in a heated and glowing vessel.⁴¹⁶ In later times, this vessel was identified with the sun and with the god Rudra Mahāvīra, and the Pravargya was incorporated into Śrauta ritual and apparently performed in the morning and evening of the second, third, and fourth days of the Soma ritual.⁴¹⁷ At this time, the Pravargya had become a more mysterious and elaborate ritual that also required the priest or the person performing the sacrifice to undergo a very specific initiation, the so-called Avāntaradīkṣā.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the (later) Pravargya, which may have been meant to reinforce the sun against the monsoon rains,⁴¹⁸ has a special connection with Savitṛ.</p>
<p>Even though it cannot be performed by and for all, it is especially mentioned in the Āpastamba-Śrautasūtra (ĀpŚS XI 2.6–10) that it may be performed for a “bad Brahmin” ( durbrāhmaṇa). Van Buitenen surmised that this refers to a Brahmin who does not regularly perform the Sandhyā, and “that this particu-</p>

<p>lar exception is made to afford to such a one the opportunity of paying Savitar through the Pravargya the respect that he otherwise had neglected.”⁴¹⁹ However, it is questionable whether the Sandhyā was already performed by adults at the time when the ĀpŚS was composed.⁴²⁰</p>
<p>The mantras used in the Śrauta Pravargya as given in the VājS (XXXVII) are preceded by twenty-four preliminary verses. They also contain the GM.</p>
<p>Here, the GM (VājS XXXVI 3) is preceded by the three Vyāhṛtis, as is also often the case in the Upanayana. Considering the relatedness of the Upanayana and the Avāntaradīkṣā,⁴²¹ a connection between their uses of the GM seems likely.⁴²²</p>
<p>But since neither the ŚatB nor the KātyŚS or other Śrautasūtras mention them, it is not clear to me when and how these verses were used, or whether they were part of the Pravargya proper or of the preceding Avāntaradīkṣā.</p>

<p>Savitṛ is addressed with the GM and ṚV V 82.9.⁴²⁶ We observe that each deity (or group of deities) is generally addressed with two verses of the same meter (the Maruts and Aditi deviate a little from the pattern), most often by the same poet and usually even from the same hymn. The KauṣB explains that these verses have been chosen because they mention specific words; in the case of the GM</p>
<p>and the verse following it, this is the word prá “forward.”⁴²⁷</p>
<p>In the earlier AitB, the verses given for this litany differ slightly.⁴²⁸ Among other changes, the place of the GM is taken by ṚV V 82.7, which hails from the same hymn as the verse following it in both litanies (V 82.9). ṚV V 82.7 is another frequently reused⁴²⁹ gāyatrī sāvitrī,⁴³⁰ which, however, does not contain any of the words specified by the AitB itself (I 10 mentions pra, netṛ, pathi, and svasti).⁴³¹</p>
<p>#<strong>15 Kauṣītaki Agnihotra (ṚV)</strong>: deity principle? (Upanayana?) The use of the GM in the Agnihotra is only prescribed by the Kauṣītaki tradition.</p>
<p>In ŚāṅkhŚS II 6–10, we find injunctions for the Śrauta form of the Agnihotra.</p>
<p>At the end of the ritual, four libations are offered into the Gārhapatya fire with simple formulae directed at Prajāpati and Agni. After these oblations, one is to offer another four libations into the Dakṣiṇāgni, reciting the GM in three parts for the first three libations in a rather peculiar way:</p>
<p>“That desirable [splendor] of the Impeller”; eaRth; speech; may more and more be mine, svāhā!</p>
<p>“the splendor of the god may we obtain”; inteRspace; bReath; may more and more be mine, svāhā!</p>
<p>426 “Who makes all these creatures hearken with his signal-call and will impel (them) forth: Savitar.” yá imā́ víśvā jātā́ni āśrāváyati ślókena / prá ca suvā́ti savitā́ //; tr. Jamison &amp; Brereton 2014: 765.</p>

<p>“who shall spur on our thoughts”; sKy; name;</p>

<p>The following, fourth libation is again accompanied by a short formula directed at “Agni, the giver of food, the lord of food” ( agnaye ’nnādāyānnapataye).</p>
<p>In this recitation, the GM can hardly be understood as a coherent text at all. Its combination with the Vyāhṛtis – the words bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ, and svaḥ – reminds one of the Upanayana, where the verse is frequently accompanied by this formula, sometimes also in a disjointed form. Considering that the Upanayana was probably also responsible for the employment of the GM in the Sandhyā, the other famous (and otherwise unrelated) Hindu morning ritual,⁴³³ it is interesting to observe that this is the only version of the Agnihotra where the verse is recited. In light of the fact that the mode of recitation even resembles that of the Upanayana and taking into account the young age of the ŚāṅkhŚS in comparison to the other Śrauta texts, it is very likely that the Upanayana did not only influence the Sandhyā, but possibly also this Śrauta form of the Agnihotra.</p>
<p>#<strong>16 Sāmaveda</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to the assertion of Staal,⁴³⁴ the GM is contained in all recensions of the Sāmaveda (SV).⁴³⁵ It is used, for instance, in the Viśvajit.⁴³⁶ Judging from the sources known to me, it seems clear that the focus of the tradition was on the gāyatrī, the “song-meter,” and not the verse. Thus, the so-called gāyatra-sāman  enjoys particular importance.⁴³⁷ While it is also sung with the GM, according to Wayne Howard, this was not the original version.⁴³⁸ The tradition only began to pay greater attention to the GM towards the end of the Vedic period: the Jaiminīya-Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa (JaimUB), also known as the “Gāyatra-Upaniṣad,”⁴³⁹ for instance, deals with the sāvitrī  in a later addition to the text.⁴⁴⁰</p>
<p>432 ŚāṅkhŚS II 10.2: tat savitur vareṇyaṃ bhūr vāg bahu bahu me bhūyāt svāhā | bhargo devasya dhīmahi bhuvaḥ prāṇo bhūyān bhūyo me bhūyāt svāhā | dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt svar ṇāma sarvaṃ sarvaṃ me bhūyāt svāhā; also translated by Caland 1953: 39.</p>
<p>433 The earliest sources mentioning the Sandhyā are the Gṛhyasūtras; see below pp. 146–152.</p>
<p>434 Staal 1986a: 56.</p>
<p>435 See SV 812 and SVJ IV 3.8.</p>
<p>436 PañcB XVI 5.5–6 (tr. Caland 1931: 433). It stands to reason that the Sāmavedins also used it in other ritual contexts. Further research is needed.</p>
<p>437 For references, see Fujii 2010. The gāyatrī-sāman  was later also reused outside Śrauta rituals proper, e.g., during a consecration ceremony according to several Pāñcarātra texts, see Hikita 2005: 173–174.</p>

<p><strong>3. Summary</strong></p>
<p>To summarize the ways the GM was reused (as just described in detail), and in order to facilitate the presentation of the material, I will first focus simply on how and why the verse is used in a given ritual from a “synchronic” and synoptic perspective. Then I will contextualize the results against the chronological and geographical backgrounds of the relevant texts and the schools that produced them. In doing so, I will retrace the way the GM took through the various rituals and how its usage developed in the course of time.</p>
<p>An analysis of all of the textual occurrences that are relevant to Śrauta ritual shows that the fact that the GM mentions Savitṛ was very often the key factor for the history of its employment. Usually it is Savitṛ’s role as “initiator”</p>
<p>and “impeller” that is revealed by the structure of litanies and rituals or is even explicitly stressed, while the notion that the GM is a prayer for light, fame, or inspiration is, in fact, never paid any attention at all.</p>
<p>The most prominent use of the GM in Śrauta ritual is that in the **Agnyupasthāna **(#1–4). Several texts of the KYV, ŚYV, and ṚV prescribe its recitation in the ritual, which could be performed daily and was particularly associated with the evening. The GM is consistently used in all Agnyupasthāna litanies as the verse directed to Savitṛ. While most of the verses used in these litanies are in the gāyatrī  meter, this is not a general rule. Thus, in this case, the fact the verse is in the gāyatrī  meter was not primary. Most likely, it was not the meaning of the verse, but the mere mention of Savitṛ, the impeller of rituals, which was taken to be the most important property of the verse.</p>
<p>The GM has probably been part of the Agnyupasthāna ritual since the very beginning. While there are also some other verses that can be found in almost all litanies, the GM is one of two verses (the other being ṚV VIII 51.7) that are present in all of them, and it is highly improbable that these verses were introduced into the several versions only after they had already been assembled.</p>
<p>We may even suspect that to some degree this reflects the fact that the GM was (or, in the course of time, came to be) seen as the “typical” sāvitrī – or, at least, a very good sāvitrī, which was not replaced or substituted as easily as other verses. Even though this daily ritual was optional, we may further surmise that the employment of the GM in it contributed much to the mantra’s becoming a frequently recited and well-known mantra, especially since it was used by Ṛgvedic and Yajurvedic traditions alike.</p>
<p>In the **Vaiśvadeva **(#5), the first Tertial Rite as prescribed by several texts of the KYV, the GM forms a pair with a verse in the jagatī  meter taken from the ṚV (IV 54.3). Here, the meter definitely played a role, as the entire litany is structured both by the order of deities as well as the meter. The creators of</p>
<p>chapteR 3 ∙ adaptive Reuse in śRauta Ritual ∙ 105</p>
<p>this litany were obviously looking for a sāvitrī  in the gāyatrī  meter (and the jagatī  meter, respectively).</p>
<p>In the <strong>Soma ritual</strong>, a litany called Vaiśvadeva-Śastra is recited (#6–10).</p>
<p>The GM appears in various versions of this litany, usually accompanied by ṚV</p>
<p>V 50.1 and V 82.7–9, and once by a verse from the MaitrS (I 2: 14.4–7). Together with the former verses, the GM is part of an introductory sequence of verses that in most variations of the litany remains the same, while the verses to the other deities (Savitṛ, Heaven and Earth, the Ṛbhus, and All Gods) vary. Savitṛ is here invoked as the first god both in the relatively stable introduction as well as in the beginnings of the following litanies.</p>
<p>In the litanies given by the VājS for the **Aśvamedha **(#11), we find an extraordinary composition. Here, the GM is the first verse in a new hymn made entirely of gāyatrī sāvitrī s, all of which are similar to the GM and the verse following it. While the first two verses of the hymn are taken from the ṚV, the others appear to be original to the VājS and were most likely inspired by the first two. The composition shows that in this case, the GM was not only used because it is a suitable sāvitrī  verse, but by occupying the first position, it may already by then have acquired a certain status. If that was the case, however, it cannot be observed throughout the entire ŚYV tradition. In the Puruṣamedha (#12) the GM is the very first verse recited on the third day of the ritual, albeit not the first mantra, as it is preceded by a short prose text addressed to Savitṛ.</p>
<p>The GM is also used in the Vājasaneyin **Pravargya **(#13) and cited in the SV (#16). Unfortunately, I could not ascertain how or why it is employed in the Pravargya, where it is conspicuously preceded by the three Vyāhṛtis. Even though the Sāmavedins had a special focus on the gāyatrī  meter, there is no indication that the GM played a particular role in their litanies. Only in late-Vedic texts is more attention paid to the mantra.</p>
<p>In the **Prāyaṇīyeṣṭi **prescribed by the Kauṣītaki texts (#14), gāyatrī sāvitrī s were sought, and the choice fell on the GM and ṚV V 82.9. Here, it is interesting to observe that in the version of the AitB, the place of the GM is taken by another frequent gāyatrī sāvitrī, which can also be found in Yajurvedic texts (ṚV</p>
<p>82.7). This could suggest that the relative frequency or prominence of individual verses might already have played a role at the time when this litany was compiled.</p>
<p>The only tradition prescribing the use of the GM in the Śrauta <strong>Agnihotra</strong> is the Kauṣītaki tradition (#15), where it may have been taken over from or inspired by the Upanayana. It is, however, impossible to draw definite conclusions.</p>
<p>106 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p><strong>4. The early history of the Gāyatrī-Mantra</strong></p>
<p>We can now attempt to give an outline of the development of the various ways the GM was employed in Śrauta ritual, based on the chronology and the localizations of the Vedic texts presented by Witzel.⁴⁴¹ In doing so, it will not be necessary to consider all of the texts that are concerned with the use of the GM</p>
<p>in Śrauta ritual; only the earliest sources attesting to a certain way of employment are relevant. Most Śrautasūtras therefore only play a secondary role, as they only give prescriptions for rituals and litanies that already existed before them.</p>
<p>In the early history of the GM, two chronological phases, each lasting several centuries,⁴⁴² can be distinguished. To this division corresponds a change of space: the texts of the first phase were produced in different geographical regions than those from the second phase. Specifically, we observe a division into an early western/central phase, and a later eastern phase. To the former belong the texts of the Maitrāyaṇīyas, Taittirīyas, and early Aitareyins, to the latter the Vājasaneyins and Kauṣītakis/Śāṅkhāyanas.</p>
<p>The first phase took place in the region Punjab and in and around the area between Ganges and Yamuna (the Doab; see Figure 2 on page xvii above), around the time of the earliest Saṃhitās of the KYV (c. twelfth century bce): the Maitrāyaṇīyas can probably be located in the Kuru realm,⁴⁴³ east to the Doab area, where the Taittirīyas lived.⁴⁴⁴ The old MaitrS and the TaittS contain texts for the Vaiśvadeva ritual – the earliest attested adaptive reuse of the GM in Śrauta ritual. This is followed by the first Taittirīya Agnyupasthāna litany, also found in the TaittS, where the GM for the first time appears as an introductory mantra.</p>
<p>The next earliest relevant text is probably the AitB, one of the oldest Brāhmaṇas,⁴⁴⁵ on which the later KauṣB depends. The early parts of the AitB, too, were probably composed in the Kuru area, north of the Sarasvatī river, in the same region as that of the Kaṭhas.⁴⁴⁶ As we saw above, the (north-)western schools viewed it more or less consistently as a “suitable,” but otherwise unre-markable ( gāyatrī) sāvitrī. Nevertheless, the GM often assumes an introductory function within the litanies, such as the several Vaiśvadeva-Śastras.</p>
<p>441 See Witzel 1987 (cf. also his summary in Witzel 1995a and 1995b: 93–97) and 1997b.</p>
<p>442 The texts and rituals that came into being during the two phases continued to be used and performed throughout the entire Vedic period and beyond, which is why the ends of both phases are even harder to define than the beginnings.</p>
<p>443 Witzel 1987: 178.</p>
<p>444 Witzel 1987: 182.</p>
<p>445 Books I–V were composed at an early date in the Punjab, see Witzel 1987: 185 and 1997b: 322.</p>
<p>446 Witzel 1987: 185.</p>
<p>chapteR 3 ∙ adaptive Reuse in śRauta Ritual ∙ 107</p>
<p>The second phase took place in a more eastern region. Most important are the texts of the ŚYV: the ŚatB, a text of the late Brāhmaṇa period (c. eighth century bce) compiled in the eastern area of Videha,⁴⁴⁷ and the VājS, a text that was created around the time or even after the ŚatB. In the VājS, the GM is part of the Agnyupasthāna litany, which was probably derived from an earlier (Taittirīya?) source. Further, the GM also appears in a rather late stratum of the text, where it is employed in two rather rarely performed rituals, the Aśvamedha and the Puruṣamedha, as well as in the Pravargya, where its employment is unclear.</p>
<p>Some time after the compilation of the VājS, the GM reappeared in the Prāyaṇīyeṣṭi of the KauṣB, where it replaces the verse ṚV V 82.7 given in the earlier and related AitB; this usage is, however, not innovative. The latest text to prescribe the employment of the GM in another Śrauta ritual, the Agnihotra, is the ŚāṅkhŚS, where it is, perhaps significantly, used in combination with the Vyāhṛtis, similar to the Pravargya. Like the KauṣB, the even later ŚāṅkhŚS can probably be located “somewhere in eastern Uttar Pradesh,”⁴⁴⁸ perhaps in Kosala, north of the confluence of Ganges and Yamuna.⁴⁴⁹</p>
<p>The eastern schools of the second phase were thus the first to employ it in a somewhat peculiar, albeit not especially innovative, way. This can be observed in the eastern Vājasaneyin Aśvamedha, Puruṣamedha, and Pravargya, as well as in the Kauṣītaki Agnihotra. It is significant that the GM slowly began to attain some kind of special status only at a comparatively late stage: as we saw above, the Agnyupasthāna litany of the VājS, which belongs to an earlier stratum of the text, is the only one in which the GM is not in an initial position.</p>
<p>As for texts mentioning the GM, chronological development also corresponds to a difference in region, as the relevant central/eastern texts are generally earlier than the western texts of the Vājasaneyins and the even later ŚāṅkhŚS. But could it be that the former influenced the latter? Were the Vājasaneyins, above all, familiar with the ways in which the GM was employed in the western schools? As Witzel has shown, this may indeed have been the case.</p>
<p>At the time of the late-Vedic ŚatB,</p>
<p>Large masses of texts were imported into the east and were made use of in rituals and in public brahmanical discussions. Whatever may have been in use in the east as Vedic ritual (perhaps an early form of the Śukla Yajurveda and the eastern Ṛgveda mentioned in ŚB) was now reshaped according to Kuru-Pañcāla [i.e., “western”] norms.⁴⁵⁰</p>

<p>450 Witzel 1997b: 330.</p>
<p>108 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>It is thus very well possible that the creators of the ŚatB and the VājS were also acquainted with the specific Agnyupasthāna litanies and the Vaiśvadeva-Śastras of the Taittirīyas and Aitareyins.</p>
<p>However, it can only be speculated if and to what extent these litanies really influenced, for instance, the creation of the idiosyncratic “Savitṛ hymn”</p>
<p>recited in the Aśvamedha. The Aśvamedha litany differs in character both from that of the Agnyupasthāna and the Soma ritual; furthermore, there were other frequently used sāvitrī s (such as ṚV I 22.5, the verse following the GM in the</p>
<p>“Savitṛ hymn”) that could have been chosen. Nevertheless, the employment of the GM in the litanies of the more eastern schools may have done its bit: as we will see in the next chapter, the mere fact that the GM had been reused more than once before might already have been decisive.</p>
<p>As we now know, the GM has not become prominent by its own merit as a text, but because it contains certain words (above all, savitṛ́) and is set in the gāyatrī  meter. The literal meaning of the mantra as a semantically meaningful arrangement of words was, as is most often the case in Śrauta litanies, secondary. There are practically no allusions to the main object of the “prayer”</p>
<p>( bhárgas, “light,” or rather: “splendor”), which was apparently only of subordinate concern for the makers of the litanies. The same holds true for dhī́-</p>
<p>(“thought, inspiration”), which only later happened to be etymologically connected with dhīmahi, the main verb of the mantra (even though it seems that this pun had already inspired the use of manāmahe  in another sāvitrī  of the ṚV).⁴⁵¹</p>
<p>While the evidence does not (yet) warrant setting up a general rule according to which the GM is the “foremost first verse,” it is clear that Savitṛ’s being the impeller or initiator is perfectly exemplified in the ritual employment of this verse. The texts themselves assert this (#1, #12) and even project this meaning onto the preverb prá “forward,” which is also linked with prathama “first” (#14,</p>
<p>#10).</p>
<p>It becomes apparent, however, that the mantra did not act “as a token of transitions and especially of beginnings” only in the ŚYV, as stated by Brereton.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it is only the old Taittirīya (KYV) and later Kauṣītaki (ṚV) texts that prescribe the GM as the very first verse in the Agnyupasthāna litany.</p>
<p>Even in the Vaiśvadeva-Śastras prescribed by the Ṛgvedic Brāhmaṇas, the GM</p>
<p>often assumes a leading or introductory function within its small liturgical context. The VājS, on the other hand, was compiled somewhat later, during the late Brāhmaṇa period (around the eighth century bce), and possibly also under the influence of some of the more western schools.⁴⁵²</p>

<p>The newly composed (and, in part, compiled) Savitṛ hymn in the Aśvamedha litany shows that at the time of its creation, the GM may already have acquired a certain renown or was, at least, comparatively well known. Considering the age of the text, however, this status was likely preconditioned by a process which had first taken place in the traditions of the KYV and ṚV. Thus, the use of the GM in the VājS did not initiate  the rise of the GM, but only belongs to a later phase of this ascension. The use of the GM in the Aśvamedha (and Puruṣamedha) is perhaps not as significant as it may seem: it must be remembered that the elaborate and expensive Aśvamedha – in comparison to the Agnyupasthāna, Agnihotra, or Vaiśvadeva – was certainly not a frequently performed ritual (the Puruṣamedha, if it ever took place, must have been even rarer).</p>
<p>These observations are also important for the discussion of the role the GM plays in the Upanayana (a Gṛhya ritual) according to the ŚatB, where it was apparently not yet without competitors.⁴⁵³ While the Yajurvedic tradition certainly “was in the vanguard in shaping late-Vedic piety,”⁴⁵⁴ as Timothy Lubin put it, there is no indication that it contributed much to the development of the GM. The use of a gāyatrī sāvitrī  in the Upanayana in general was also known to the authors of the roughly contemporaneous Kaṭha-Brāhmaṇa, but neither this text nor the ŚatB nor the VājS specify that it is the GM that should be used in this ritual.⁴⁵⁵ Even in the other parts of the ŚatB and the VājS, the verse is not (yet) treated as a mantra that is essentially different from others.⁴⁵⁶</p>
<p>It must be stressed that in Śrauta ritual in general, the GM can hardly be said to be special. As we observe in the litanies of other traditions, there were also other frequently cited and used sāvitrī s, which sometimes even took the place of the GM. Especially with regard to its embedding in the Upanayana, it would be an exaggeration to assume that the GM was the only possible choice.</p>
<p>While it is tempting to project the GM’s later fame onto its “adolescence,” it must be remembered that in the minds of the ritual experts of the time, it was only one among thousands. As we will see in the next chapter, however, among actually reused sāvitrī s, the GM was, in fact, one among few, and while it did have competitors, its employment in Śrauta ritual provided it – as well as several other sāvitrī s – with an excellent background to “go places” in Gṛhya ritual, too.</p>
<p>The pivotal moment in the history of the GM was, without doubt, its selection as an initiation mantra in the Upanayana.</p>

<p>455 Cf. below p. 145.</p>
<p>456 Interestingly, the Gṛhyasūtras of the Taittirīyas and the ŚYV also do not even mention the Sandhyā, the second most important ritual for the development of the GM; see Einoo 1992: 59–60.</p>
