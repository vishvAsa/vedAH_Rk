In Chapter 4 I argued that a sāvitrī was sought to inaugurate Vedic studentship due to the fact that Savitṛ was often invoked at the beginning of rituals and litanies in Śrauta ritual. While occasionally sāvitrī s in other meters were prescribed as well, the gāyatrī was always considered primary. The Gāyatrī-Mantra was selected from a variety of sāvitrī s because it was already frequently reused in Śrauta ritual. It is likely that the GM was the first gāyatrī sāvitrī to be chosen in this way, even though the earliest sources are surprisingly unspecific in this regard.">

  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In Chapter 4 I argued that a sāvitrī  was sought to inaugurate Vedic studentship due to the fact that Savitṛ was often invoked at the beginning of rituals and litanies in Śrauta ritual. While occasionally sāvitrī s in other meters were prescribed as well, the gāyatrī  was always considered primary. The Gāyatrī-Mantra was selected from a variety of sāvitrī s because it was already frequently reused in Śrauta ritual. It is likely that the GM was the first gāyatrī sāvitrī  to be chosen in this way, even though the earliest sources are surprisingly unspecific in this regard.</p>
<p>Later developments show that the employment of the GM as an initiation mantra was a pivotal event in its history. As it became the mantra that makes a person a full member of the ārya  society, it also became important outside the liturgical and ritual domains. The mantra was praised in increasingly higher terms, and was soon understood to be a quasi-divine entity. Several centuries after it had been integrated into the Upanayana, it had become so highly revered that the author of the famous MānDhŚ ( vulgo  Manu) concluded that “nothing is higher than the sāvitrī” ( sāvitryās tu paraṃ nāsti).⁵⁷⁸ The eminence ascribed to the mantra not only led to the creation of the so-called modified GMs, but it also rendered it possible to call other texts sāvitrī, even though they had no resemblance to the GM whatsoever.⁵⁷⁹ The central role the mantra played in the Brahminical cult was also recognized by Buddhist authors.⁵⁸⁰</p>
<p>The aim of this chapter is to explore how and in what sense the GM</p>
<p>achieved this status. The period to be investigated ranges from the end of the 578 See below p. 161.</p>
<p>579 Thus, the four verses in MBh IIXX 5.47–50 are called bhāratasāvitrī, that is, “the verse(s) concerned with the Bhāratas (or the Mahābhārata), which verse(s) is especially sacred like the Sāvitrī.” Kajihara 2019: 27. The Śiva-Dharmaśāstra (ŚivDhŚ VIII 91–95: 99.22–31) also knows of a gosāvitrī, a “sāvitrī  for cows,” but does not explicitly specify a mantra that would be similar to a sāvitrī, which might suggest that the mantra given in the preceding text (81–89) is meant as a sāvitrī. Interestingly, neither of the two “sāvitrī s” shows any resemblance with the GM.</p>
<p>580 See Shults 2014: 114–120 and Kajihara 2019: 27–29; cf. also Bausch 2015: 53–54.</p>
<p>140 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>Vedic era, usually (and somewhat arbitrarily) dated to the fifth century bce, up to approximately the second or third century ce, the time when the MānDhŚ</p>
<p>was composed.⁵⁸¹ The main sources examined for this analysis are the religious manuals produced in that period, that is, the (early) Gṛhyasūtras, Dharmasūtras as well as the MānDhŚ.⁵⁸² Significantly, the GM does not appear as an independent goddess in these texts (unlike other deities such as Indra, Viṣṇu, or Śiva). While a small number of other texts from the same period already show first traces of a personification and divinization of the GM,⁵⁸³ in my view, the absence of a mantra goddess in the ritual and Dharma literature reflects the fact that the GM had not yet (and consistently) come to be conceived of as a deity.</p>
<p>While the religious texts of Early Hinduism can be surveyed more or less exhaustively, this is impossible for the much more extensive later literature, where the ritual applications of mantras became more numerous and, to a limited extent, more diversified. Classical Hinduism was (among many other things) characterized by the development of new Gṛhya practices, as the supplements and additions to the existing literature, the so-called “Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa texts,” show.⁵⁸⁴ Despite their significance for the further development of Hinduism, these texts are largely understudied. Being beyond the historical horizon of this chapter, they will not be considered here. Select passages concerning the deification of the GM will, however, be dealt with in Chapter 8.</p>
<p>The discussion of the material is arranged into several sections; they follow what I identify as the most important aspects of the GM in this period. Going through the more than one hundred text passages perused for this chapter, I have found that the mantra was rarely used in a “sporadic” fashion. Rather, it had already attained a certain status even before the earliest Gṛhyasūtras were composed. I argue that this status and the use of the GM in ritual practice continuously influenced each other. Thus, the GM functioned as the key mantra both in the initiation into the ārya  society as well as in the daily morning and evening rituals. This led to it being considered the “first and foremost” or most important Vedic verse. As a consequence, it was recited as the first mantra in other ritual contexts too, which in turn further consolidated its role and status.</p>
<p>Eventually, it even came to be regarded as the “epitome of the Vedas.”</p>
<p>The present chapter consists of five sections:</p>
<p>• **Section 1 **(pp. 142–146) briefly describes the historical background of Brahminism, the ideology that had the greatest influence on the development of the GM. I also dwell on the history of the Upanayana and its connection 581 For simplicity’s sake, I refer to this period as “Early Hinduism”; see above pp. 35–36.</p>
<p>582 For the chronology of the Gṛhyasūtras, see n. 465 on p. 112 above.</p>
<p>583 See Chapter 6.</p>
<p>584 For these texts, see below pp. 232–233.</p>
<p>chapteR 5 ∙ status in eaRly hinduism ∙ 141</p>
<p>with the sāvitrī, as well as the development of the concept of dvijāti  or</p>
<p>“second birth.”</p>
<p>• **Section 2 **(pp. 146–153) presents several cases where the GM is the first mantra. Most important is the Sandhyā, a ritual performed daily in the morning and evening. I discuss the possible origins of this ritual, considering also the etiological “Sandhyā myth.”</p>
<p>• **Section 3 **(pp. 153–159) analyzes the position of the GM in certain Gṛhyasūtra passages that give lists of entities worthy of worship (including not only deities proper, but also more abstract entities such as texts and meters). I demonstrate that the GM, being the only verse present in the lists, was thought to be the “foremost” Vedic verse. As such, it came to stand “on a par” with the entire Vedic corpus.</p>
<p>• **Section 4 **(pp. 159–164) explores how the GM became the “epitome” of the Vedas on several levels. I return to the cultural background, suggesting that the compression of the Vedas into a single verse was facilitated by making access to them one of the main characteristics of members of all of the upper classes.</p>
<p>• **Section 5 **(pp. 164–166) elaborates on a use of the GM that was presumably the result of the developments presented in the preceding sections: its recitation was often prescribed as a purificatory practice, whose purpose, I argue, was to maintain the ritual and social identity of the reciter, an identity that was first given to him in the Upanayana.</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter, I will switch back and forth between the analysis of textual evidence and the discussion of the context and background necessary to explain my findings. In each section, I follow the principle of chronology (as far as this is possible), usually addressing older texts first. In a way, the order of the five sections also reflects a possible historical, and even causal, development.</p>
<p>As will be seen, however, it is often very difficult to establish when exactly a particular practice or notion came into being, or to estimate to what degree it had developed at a certain point in time. My main aim, therefore, has been to follow the path of the GM “from the bird’s eye view” (but in doing so I have nevertheless sought to have those eyes be those of an eagle, as it were).</p>
<p>Lastly, a remark on terminology is necessary: The word sāvitrī  is used frequently in the texts under discussion. Generally there is no reason to assume that in the relevant cases, it refers to any other mantra than the GM. Keeping in line with the usage of the texts under discussion, however, throughout the</p>
<p>142 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>chapter I often (but not always) refer to the mantra as “the sāvitrī” (as opposed to “a sāvitrī”).⁵⁸⁵</p>
<p><strong>1. The historical background</strong></p>
<p>Most important for the ascendancy and consolidation of the GM is the history of Brahminism, a specific ideology within the broader category of Vedic religion and Hinduism. Brahminism is characterized by the axiom that Brahmins and everything that is associated with them is, in every respect – be it social, cultural, or religious – superior to others.⁵⁸⁶ This attitude had precursors in the Vedic period, when Brahmins and Kṣatriyas joined forces in order to oppress the rest of the population.⁵⁸⁷ Over the course of time, it developed into an ideology that spread across the entirety of South Asia, and beyond.</p>
<p>In the first half of the first millennium bce, the core region of Brahminical culture was located in and around the region Punjab and the Doab between the Ganges and the Yamuna (see Figure 2 on page xvii above), from where it slowly spread to the east and to the south.⁵⁸⁸ From around the fifth century bce onwards, however, other religious currents emerged, most importantly, Buddhism and Jainism. These anti-Brahminical currents possibly originated in a more south-eastern region⁵⁸⁹ and quickly began to increase their influence in the political sphere. Brahminism entered into competition with these other currents, and in the process became a much broader movement.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning and unfolding of this movement,⁵⁹⁰ an entirely new kind of literature evolved. From around the third century bce onwards,⁵⁹¹ some Brahmins began to codify their ethical norms as well as personal and criminal law in the Dharmasūtras.⁵⁹² In doing so, one of their greatest concerns was to demarcate who belongs to the society to which their rules should apply, and to define the social boundaries within this society.⁵⁹³</p>
<p>585 Cf. Table 2 on p. 2 above.</p>
<p>586 For an overview, see Bronkhorst 2021.</p>
<p>587 See Witzel 1995a: 18–19.</p>
<p>588 Cf. Bronkhorst 2007: 1–2.</p>
<p>589 Bronkhorst (2007) has called this region “Greater Magadha.” According to his theory, this region was characterized by a distinct material and, above all, spiritual culture that was not (yet) dominated by Brahminism.</p>
<p>590 For a number of scholars, the changes Brahminism underwent were so profound that it is appropriate to speak of a “new Brahminism” (Bronkhorst 2011: 27) or “Neo-Brahmanism”</p>
<p>(McGovern 2019: 21).</p>

<p>593 Above all by introducing the Varṇa system, which “was from the start an ideologically driven enterprise designed to place the Brāhmaṇa at the top of a pyramidal social hier-</p>
<p>chapteR 5 ∙ status in eaRly hinduism ∙ 143</p>
<p>Members of this society called themselves ārya s or “noble ones.”⁵⁹⁴ In Sanskrit, ārya  is a generic term used to designate “decent” people; exactly who is meant by this word depends on the speaker. In the Brahminical definition, an ārya  is basically a decent, cultured, Sanskrit-speaking person (and ideally married and male) who accepts Brahmin authority and acts according to Brahminical standards. Being – and, especially, remaining – an ārya  demanded a certain lifestyle and involved the observance of a great number of (ritual) laws, customs, and behaviors. In order to become an acceptable ārya  in the first place, however, it became crucial to undergo a certain ritual of initiation: the Upanayana. Over time, this ritual became an essential part in defining who was a</p>
<p>“proper” member of the ārya  society, and who was not.⁵⁹⁵</p>
<p>The Upanayana originally served as an initiation into Vedic studentship.⁵⁹⁶</p>
<p>While the evidence suggests that originally only Brahmins underwent it, at some point, it was proclaimed to be obligatory for non-Brahmin ārya s as well⁵⁹⁷</p>
<p>(while sometimes also being modified in order to uphold and again underscore the Brahmins’ superiority).⁵⁹⁸ Lubin described this as follows: In the gr̥hyasūtra s, the claim is first made that study of the Veda is not merely available to but incumbent on kṣatriya s and vaiśya s as well as Brahmins, with the corollary that initiation and the daily use of Vedic mantra s become the defining mark of elite, Ārya status in a religiously and ethni-cally diverse society. […] The priestly canonization of household ( gr̥hya) ritual, with an accompanying emphasis on trans-regional standardization and the promotion of simplified forms of observance, made the prestige and alleged power of the Vedic cult accessible to a wider range of social and economic statuses. […] The shift toward universalization is virtually completed with the Mānavadharmaśāstra, which was no longer understood as specially relevant to the Mānava division of the Black Yajur Vedins but on the contrary lay claim to recording divine knowledge applicable to all Āryas, and essential to the successful governance of a royal state.⁵⁹⁹</p>

<p>As part of this process of universalization, the Upanayana became an initiation into society, that is, an obligatory rite of passage. This development had a lasting influence on Hindu culture:</p>
<p>What was originally a consecration rite became a life-cycle rite of passage and a socioritualistic transformation in the system of norms of the specific extended families. Thus, this rite takes priority over all other rites of passage. For the formation of Hindu identity, initiation is perhaps even more significant than the wedding, for no son can be married without being initiated. All male Hindus who employ Brahman priests are initiated, but not all get married. Initiation is also indispensable for the right to perform death and ancestor rites.⁶⁰⁰</p>
<p>From the time of the Dharmasūtras onwards, all those who underwent it came to be called dvija s, or “twice-born,” a term that was rarely used previously and more often than not only to denote Brahmins.⁶⁰¹ Undergoing the Upanayana thus not only became the necessary prerequisite for one’s active participation in Vedic and Brahminical rituals, but also made a person a full-fledged member of the ārya  society. Birth alone was not (or no longer) sufficient.⁶⁰²</p>
<p>The corollary of the extension of the Upanayana was that every dvija learned a sāvitrī, in most cases, the GM. Though many non-Brahmin dvija s would certainly never learn any great amount of Vedic texts (an important fact to which I will return in Section 5), the position of the GM in the initiation ritual ensured that every dvija  knew and associated it with the Vedas, the Brahmins and everything connected to them. In fact, even if they never formally learned it, we may safely assume that many non-initiates shared this association. As the Upanayana has continued to be performed in many Hindu traditions up to the present day, this specific verse could reappear again and again as one of the hallmarks of “orthodox” Hinduism.</p>
<p>This status was soon recognized and emphasized within the tradition, and a special connection was established between the Upanayana and the GM.</p>
<p>While the position of the GM was not necessarily emphasized in the descriptions of the Sūtras or in the ceremony itself – indeed, the Upanayana includes several other ritual procedures – the teaching of a sāvitrī  was an essential and crucial component.⁶⁰³ This can be observed (1) in the historical development of the ritual, (2) in the way it was connected with the social domain, as well as (3) on the “theological” level.</p>

<p>First, from the ŚatB onwards, a sāvitrī  was taught in all versions of the Upanayana,⁶⁰⁴ and was explicitly prescribed for all three Vedas (excluding, as so often, the AV).⁶⁰⁵ Considering that the early “Brahmanical institutions were diffuse and intensely localized”⁶⁰⁶ and that the authors of the Gṛhyasūtras themselves were very aware of the multitude of Gṛhya practices,⁶⁰⁷ the existence of a specific ritual practice compulsory for brahmacārin s of all Vedic schools is striking. Teaching a sāvitrī  must have been an integral component of the (revised) initiation ritual from an early point onwards. The practice was probably introduced after the AV and during or possibly even before the time of the late-Vedic ŚatB and KaṭhB.⁶⁰⁸ It seems likely that it was devised towards the end of the Vedic period, as part of what could be called the “Śrauta revision” of Gṛhya rituals.⁶⁰⁹</p>
<p>Second, it seems that the practice of teaching a sāvitrī  became especially important when the Upanayana was turned into a rite of passage obligatory for all three ārya  classes. This is shown in the way that those who do not undergo it are referred to. In the Brahminical system, initiation could only be post-poned and made up, never passed over. In theory, one even had to learn one’s sāvitrī  before a certain age:⁶¹⁰ if one failed to do so, one became a patitasāvitrīka,</p>
<p>“someone who has forfeited the sāvitrī.”⁶¹¹ Such a person would be excluded from the society of twice-born ārya s, as one could not marry them or even speak with them.⁶¹² The existence of this technical term points to what was perceived as the essential act of the Upanayana.</p>
<p>Lastly, the role of the sāvitrī  in the Upanayana was also reflected on a theological level. This role is often emphasized in those texts that conceptualize the ritual as a “second birth” ( dvijāti).⁶¹³ The association of the ritual with birth is already found in the AV, where it is said that during the initiation, the teacher carries the student in his belly for three nights.⁶¹⁴ The teaching of a sāvitrī, however, is not mentioned in this text, but only in the comparatively later KaṭhB and ŚatB. Both texts explicitly connect this very likely innovative practice with birth 604 See above pp. 111–112.</p>
<p>605 See, for instance, ĀpDhS I 1.10 (tr. Olivelle 2000: 25; cf. also his n. on p. 472).</p>

<p>612 See Lubin 1994: 176–177.</p>
<p>613 Most Gṛyhasūtras do not show any trace of the existence of this conception (cf. Olivelle 2012a: 124–125). However, this does not necessarily show that it did not exist in any form, but can be explained by the fact that these texts generally do not show much concern for theology or interpretation.</p>

<p>symbolism. In the KaṭhB, for instance, it is said that “this brahmacārin  is born together with ( sahá) the sāvitrī.”⁶¹⁵ The focus here is on the temporal sequences in the initiation process, on the teacher’s being pregnant with the student, and that pregnancy’s duration lasting three days or a year. The word sahá, “with,”</p>
<p>indicates simultaneity: the brahmacārin  is (re-)born just at the same time that he is taught the sāvitrī, which marks the beginning of his new life.</p>
<p>The rebirth of the student and the teaching of a sāvitrī  continued to be strongly associated together throughout the next two millennia. Around the beginning of the Common Era, the mantra even came to be called the “mother”</p>
<p>of the initiate.⁶¹⁶ While it formerly only accompanied the rebirth of the student (the teacher being the one who became pregnant and gave birth), it now at least metaphorically became a ritual agent. This personification of the sāvitrī –</p>
<p>in practice, most often the GM – illustrates how its significance increased in the course of time. (I will return to the subject of personification in Part II of this study.)</p>
<p>The following section turns to the role of the GM in the Sandhyā, one of the most important Hindu rituals. As we will see, the presence of the GM in this ritual was very likely a consequence of its use in the Upanayana. The GM</p>
<p>is repeated several times in the Sandhyā, which, as a ritual that is performed daily, became a powerful “amplifier” of the mantra.</p>
<p><strong>2. The first Vedic verse</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 The Sandhyā and its origins</strong></p>
<p>The sandhyopāsana, the “worship at/of⁶¹⁷ the juncture(s)” of day and night (i.e., the two twilights, dawn and dusk), or abbreviated simply sandhyā  is a ritual that is generally performed twice daily, before sunrise and after sunset (and sometimes also at noon, another “juncture”).⁶¹⁸ As observed by Einoo, in the earliest texts dealing with the ritual, the Sandhyā was still a rather simple ritual.</p>
<p>According to the ĀśvGS, for instance, it basically consisted in the recitation of the GM; the KāṭhGS additionally mentions that it was to be preceded by om  and the Vyāhṛtis.⁶¹⁹ But even as other ritual actions and mantras were added (their 615 sá vā́ eṣá brahmacārī́ sāvitryā́ sahá prájāyate  KaṭhB L 10 (also translated by Kajihara 2002: 270); see also ŚatB XI 5.4.12.</p>

<p>619 ĀśvGS III 7.4 and KāṭhGS I 28. The other potentially early Gṛhyasūtra passages mentioned by Einoo (1992: 59) are ŚāṅkhGS II 9.1–3, KauṣGS II 6.3–4, MānGS I 2.1–5, VārGS</p>
<p>V 30, and JaimGS I 13. The ŚāṅkhGS and the closely related KauṣGS additionally in-</p>

<p>number has grown considerably over the course of time),⁶²⁰ later texts, too, time and again emphasize the recitation of the GM. To give but one example from the MānDhŚ:</p>
<p>At the morning twilight, he should stand reciting softly the Sāvitrī verse until the sun comes into view; at the evening twilight, however, he should remain properly seated until the Big Dipper becomes clearly visible. When he stands reciting softly at the morning twilight, he banishes any sin committed during the night; and when he sits at the evening twilight, he removes any taint contracted during the day. A man who neither stands at the morning twilight nor sits at the evening twilight should be excluded like a Śūdra from all rites of the twice-born.⁶²¹</p>
<p>Recitation of the GM has always been considered the most important component of the ritual.⁶²² Looking at the earliest prescriptions, it even stands to reason that originally it was the only component of the ritual, around which other elements were gradually added.⁶²³ Most of these are clearly “day-to-day rituals” whose purpose is often (but not always) to uphold or renew the ritual purity of the performer. Among them are, for instance, ācamana, the “sipping”</p>
<p>of water for purification; aghamarṣaṇa, “making the sins forgiven”; mārjana,</p>
<p>“purifying” oneself; and arghya, making an “honorary offering” of water to the sun. These components continued to vary considerably in different traditions,⁶²⁴</p>
<p>which certainly did not make it easy to attribute a unified meaning or purpose to the ritual.</p>
<p>→</p>
<p>clude the Svastyayanas (according to Oldenberg [ SBE  XXIX: 74, n. ad ŚāṅkhGS II 9.2],</p>
<p>“[t]he Svastyayanas are texts such as Rig-veda I, 89; IV, 31”). Whether the Sandhyā of the MānGS, which is discussed in detail below pp. 189–192, belongs in its entirety to the same stage as, for instance, the KāṭhGS, remains open. The VārGS and the JaimGS</p>
<p>are both probably comparatively late; see n. 465 on p. 112 above; for the latter, see also below pp. 247–248. ĀpDhS I 30.8, GautDhS II 10–11, and VasDhS VII 16 only allude to the ritual, but do not mention any mantras; cf. Einoo 1992: 62.</p>

<p>622 Cf. Kane II(1): 314 and Rastelli 2014: 271: “In the Vedic orthodox form of the sandhyā  ritual, the most important mantra is the gāyatrī.” In many forms of ritual, the mantra is recited not just once, but up to one hundred times. The recitation of the GM therefore takes up a lot of time in the ritual, in many cases probably the most. This circumstance certainly had a great influence on how the role of the mantra was perceived in the Sandhyā.</p>
<p>623 A more detailed examination of the history of the Sandhyā, especially with regard to its relationship to daily personal recitation and individual Veda practice ( svādhyāya), would be worth a study of its own.</p>

<p>148 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>It appears that, at some point, this situation preoccupied some of those who performed the ritual, as they supplied the composite ritual with a myth explaining how it works. According to this etiological myth, which has been called the “Sandhyā myth,” the purpose of the ritual performed in the morning is to help the sun rise. The first one to draw attention to the myth was Doris Srinivasan (1973), who studied its various manifestations in several texts. As I could not put it any better, I will quote her summary:</p>
<p>As soon as the sun sets, demons are there to attack it. They try to de-vour the sun to keep it from rising. In order for sunlight to reappear, the struggle must be resolved. Alone the sun is not strong enough to defeat its enemies. A spell is divinely revealed to effectuate the desired outcome.</p>
<p>The spell, when uttered in a ritual context taps the power of bráhman. The worshipper must perform certain ritual actions precisely during the transition from night to day and from day to night. He must stand, facing East during the former time span; during the latter he must sit facing West.</p>
<p>Doing so, and throwing up water consecrated by the spell conquers the enemies of the sun. The drops of water become thunderbolts ( vajra) and these strike down the demons. To assist the sun, the twice-born throw up abundant water in the Saṃdhyā. Thereby, they stave off, for that day, the sun’s foes and foster sunrise. A curse placed on these demons prevents them from ever dying. Thus the same battle is waged each night (from the setting until the dawning of light). This necessitates that Saṃdhyā must never be neglected. He who fails to do this duty is a killer of the sun; he who observes this duty promotes the uninterrupted succession of days and nights. In this manner, the sun maintains its course.⁶²⁵</p>
<p>Does this myth reflect the original purpose of the ritual – if there ever was only one? The presumably oldest text passages containing the Sandhyā</p>
<p>myth are the Ṣaḍviṃśa-Brāhmaṇa (ṢaḍvB) and the TaittĀ, both translated in Srinivasan’s article.⁶²⁶ Portions of these texts were certainly composed after the Vedic period.⁶²⁷ While a closer examination of their dates lies outside the scope of this study, it is possible to make a few basic observations.</p>
<p>625 Srinivasan 1973: 168–169. The summary is based on more than eleven Vedic and post-Vedic texts, see Srinivasan 1973: 168.</p>
<p>626 ṢaḍvB IV 5.2–4, see pp. 169–170; TaittĀ II 2, see p. 170. A similar ritual act is also mentioned in KauṣU II 7, where Sarvajit Kauṣītaki is said to have venerated the sun three times a day by pouring water three times into a pot.</p>
<p>627 For the TaittĀ, see above pp. 79–80. The date of the composite ṢaḍvB (Caland 1931: ii–</p>
<p>iii), an appendix of the Pañcaviṃśa-Brāhmaṇa (PañcB), is unclear. Judging from the language, the Sandhyā myth contained in this text is clearly post-Vedic; indeed, it even seems to contain intertextual references to texts such as the BaudhDhS and the GautDhS; see Srinivasan 1973: 170, nn. 43 and 45.</p>
<p>chapteR 5 ∙ status in eaRly hinduism ∙ 149</p>
<p>An important detail is that the “demons” (Asuras) are struck down by the water thrown up by the performer, “water which is consecrated with the Gāyatrī” ( gayatriyābhimantritenāmbhasā), as the TaittĀ elucidates. First, the act of throwing up water is not mentioned in the earliest Gṛhyasūtras.⁶²⁸ Second, the fact that the texts designate the performer of the Sandhyā simply as “Brahmin”</p>
<p>( brāhmaṇa  in the ṢaḍvB) or even “learned Brahmin” ( brāhmaṇo vidvān  in the TaittĀ), suggests to me that they conceive of him as an adult (rather than as a young brahmacārin), another factor that, as I discuss below,⁶²⁹ points to a rather late date. A comparatively late date would also support the theory put forward in Chapter 1 that the word gāyatrī  was probably introduced as a second name of the mantra only after the second century ce.⁶³⁰</p>
<p>We can also observe that the GM itself does not feature very prominently in the myth: in the ṢaḍvB, it is simply viewed as just one part of the Sandhyā, and in the TaittĀ, it serves to consecrate the water that then strikes down the Asuras. While the recitation of the GM is certainly essential in the Sandhyā</p>
<p>ritual, it is not essential in the Sandhyā myth itself: the drops of water could be consecrated with any other mantra, and indeed, the ṢaḍvB mentions the recitation of other verses, ṚV X 190.1–3,⁶³¹ even before the GM. The Sandhyā</p>
<p>myth, therefore, is most likely secondary: it was only attached to the composite ritual after it had already been in existence for some time. It cannot be applied to the simplest (and presumably earliest) form of the ritual, which only consists in the recitation of the GM, and hence does not really help to explain how this mantra found its way into the Sandhyā.</p>
<p>But could it be that there was another connection between the mantra and other elements of the ritual – such as the time stipulated for its performance –</p>
<p>a connection that was never explicitly stated, possibly because it was too obvious? As mentioned, the deity Savitṛ has always been associated with the times of morning and evening or, more specifically, with the times before sunrise and after sunset.⁶³² This association continued even when the sun came to be seen as his primary manifestation. Especially in the Vedic period, he was conceived of as an impeller and initiator, a function that was closely connected with his association with the beginning and the end of the day. Considering this prehistory – and the fact that after the Vedic period, the word savitṛ  itself began to be used synonymously with other words designating the sun – it would be natu-628 Cf. Srinivasan 1973: 166.</p>
<p>629 See below pp. 150–151.</p>
<p>630 That the mantra, and not the meter is meant, is indicated by the word abhimantrita “addressed” or “consecrated with a mantra.”</p>
<p>631 See Srinivasan 1973: 172. The verses belong to the so-called Aghamarṣaṇa-Sūkta; see Kane II(1): 317.</p>
<p>632 See above pp. 44–46.</p>
<p>150 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>ral to assume that Savitṛ’s nature and the daily recitation of the sāvitrī  before sunrise and after sunset are in some way connected.⁶³³</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, this connection is never mentioned or alluded to in any of the earliest sources. I have not found explicit evidence for it in any of the texts pre-dating the Common Era. The same holds true for a possible connection of the sāvitrī  and the goddess Sūryā Sāvitrī, who was likewise associated with the time of morning.⁶³⁴ It would have been no big step to identify the sandhyā, that is, the “twilight” that is supposedly being worshipped ( upa+ ās), with or as Sūryā Sāvitrī – but this was apparently never done, at least not explicitly.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not even entirely clear whether sandhyopāsana  or the various expressions used in this context refer to an adoration of  the twilight.⁶³⁵ It is certainly possible that the earliest practitioners already interpreted it as such, but it remains difficult to show that this was the motivation behind the creation of the entire ritual. Savitṛ’s being the sun might not have been the primary reason for the recitation of a sāvitrī  in the Sandhyā, nor was it the identification of the time with the goddess Sūryā Sāvitrī, or identification with the goddess and the celestial light visible at that time – all of which are lacking in evidence.</p>
<p>In the following, I will propose another explanation that is based on the putative historical development of the ritual.</p>
<p>According to Shingo Einoo,⁶³⁶ the Sandhyā was originally performed only by Vedic students. Apparently it “is in the Yājñavalkyasmṛti that it is for the first 633 As argued, for instance, by Anand (1988: 4–7).</p>
<p>634 See Chapter 7.</p>
<p>635 I have not found any early sources that explicitly state that the twilight is the object of worship (one of the earliest is the late VaikhGS [VI 8], which uses the expression sandhyām ādityaṃ copasthāya “having worshipped the Twilight/Juncture and the sun”).</p>
<p>The most frequently used expression is saṃdhyām upa+ ās (e.g., saṃdhyām upāsīta  ĀśvGS</p>
<p>III 7–3 and KāṭhGS I 25; saṃdhyām upāste  MānGS I 2.1 and KauṣGS II 6.3). However, the verb upa+ ās, literally “to sit down next to,” not only means “to perform worship,” but also simply “to perform” (cf. ye … agnihotram upāsate “those who perform the Agnihotra” MānDhŚ XI 42). If saṃdhyā  is understood to be the designation of the ritual (the</p>
<p>“Juncture/Twilight”), the expression saṃdhyām upa+ ās  can be translated as “to perform the Juncture/Twilight (worship/ritual).” But yet another interpretation is possible. We occasionally also encounter the expression saṃdhyām ās (e.g., saṃdhyām āset  VārGS</p>
<p>V 30, saṃdhyām āste  ŚāṅkhGS II 9). The simplex ās  cannot take a direct object, but may, for instance, be used with an internal accusative (e.g., sattram ās, “to sit a session”) or, more frequently, with an adverbial, temporal accusative (“during, through, for the time of”). An adverbial use of saṃdhyām  is clearly given in cases where the verb sthā “to stand” is used, as for instance in MānDhŚ II 101a = 102a = IV 93c: pūrvāṃ saṃdhyāṃ japaṃs tiṣṭhet “during the morning juncture, he shall stand, softly reciting.” While upa+ ās  is most often used with direct accusative objects, it is not impossible to understand saṃdhyām  in saṃdhyām upa+ ās  as an adverbial accusative, i.e., “worship (during) the juncture.” To account for all these possible interpretations, I generally translate saṃdhyām upa+ ās  with “to perform the Juncture (worship),” which leaves open whether the ritual itself is called “Juncture/Twilight,” is a worship of the Juncture/Twilight, or is simply performed at/during the two junctures/ twilight times.</p>

<p>time explicitly taught that the householder too should perform this daily ceremony,”⁶³⁷ that is, in a text as late as the fourth or fifth century ce.⁶³⁸ Originally, therefore, the Sandhyā was restricted to the time of studentship. As a matter of fact, the Sandhyā was one of the first simple rituals one had to learn after initiation, possibly even the very first. This is clearly expressed, for instance, in the MānDhŚ, which states that “after initiating a student, the teacher should at the outset train him in purification, proper conduct, (the ritual of) taking care of the fire ( agnikārya),⁶³⁹ and performing the Juncture (worship).”⁶⁴⁰ It is well known that there are ritual regulations for many, if not most, of the daily activities of a religious practitioner, be it a student or a householder.⁶⁴¹ Along with the similarly simple agnikārya, the Sandhyā was one of the first proper rituals to be learned by the young student.</p>
<p>I hypothesize that the daily recitation of a sāvitrī  might have begun as a simple exercise for young brahmacārin s. In preparation for the study of longer Vedic texts, they were given the task of reciting one verse correctly at a specific time each day. Since the sāvitrī  is the first Vedic verse that the student learns, it is even impossible for him to recite another text (not having yet learned any), at least for a certain – if very short – time.⁶⁴² After and alongside memorization, as well as accustoming the student to regular and disciplined individual recitation,⁶⁴³ reciting the sāvitrī  may also have fulfilled another – most likely even more important – function: as the sāvitrī s played an important role in the definition of the students’ new social identity, their recitation may have served a similar purpose as most of the other elements of the Sandhyā, that is, the renewal of their purity. The recitation of the sāvitrī  may have had a similar momentum as the initiation ritual: learning a sāvitrī  made the young boy a brahmacārin, and by repeating the same mantra, this status was restored with each new day. As such, it could also be interpreted as a purificatory practice, a principle that I will discuss in more detail below.⁶⁴⁴</p>

<p>‘as long as there is no imparting of the Gāyatrī there is no saṁdhyā.’ So the student begins his saṁdhyā in the noon of the day of Upanayana. As however on that day he knows no Vedic text except the Gāyatrī, his whole saṁdhyā worship consists of the Gāyatrī.”</p>

<p>Whatever its origins, the Sandhyā became one of the most regularly performed Hindu rituals, and with it the regular repetition of the sāvitrī. Even though for a long time the Sandhyā was primarily part of the students’ daily routine, it is conceivable that it was already being performed by some adults before the YājñSm was composed.⁶⁴⁵ As brahmacārin s, in any case, they used to repeat the sāvitrī, up to one hundred times (or even more often), at the beginning and end of each day, and even ideally, throughout their studies (or, in the case of life-long brahmacārin s and later also householders, throughout their entire lives).</p>
<p>Even without conducting a psychological study, it is easily understood that this daily and repeated recitation must have made a great impact on the minds of the reciters. There can be little doubt that it contributed much to the “snowball effect” proposed above, and it made it more likely that the sāvitrī  would reappear in other ritual contexts. As explained above, the triṣṭubh  and jagatī sāvitrī s were substitutes of the GM.⁶⁴⁶ While they were probably also used in the Sandhyā, at least by some,⁶⁴⁷ the GM was certainly used more frequently. Those who were responsible for creating new rituals (or modifying existing ones), in any case, were the Brahmins, who would always recite the GM. Accordingly, the Sandhyā</p>
<p>above all affected the development of this sāvitrī.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 The Gāyatrī-Mantra as the first mantra in other contexts</strong> In a number of cases we observe that, when the GM is combined with other mantras, it is assigned a special, initial position. The following provides several examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>In at least two codified rituals, the GM serves as a kind of prelude to other Vedic verses: one passage of the ŚāṅkhGS prescribes its recitation in the pratyavarohaṇa  or “redescending,” a ritual that is performed after the time of the year when one does not sleep on the ground (in order not to be bitten by a snake).⁶⁴⁸ Here, the GM (preceded by the Vyāhṛtis) is in an initial position, heralding ṚV I 97, an entire hymn in the gāyatrī  meter.⁶⁴⁹ In the context of a 645 Einoo (1992: 66–67) noted that the earlier MānDhŚ does not (yet) mention it as one of the daily duties of a householder. However, it seems plausible to me that in practice some householders performed the ritual (or rather, continued to perform it after they were no longer brahmacārin s) even before the YājñSm was composed, and that the author of this text did not introduce the practice, but only wanted to provide it with legitimacy.</p>
<p>646 See above p. 126.</p>
<p>647 Cf. the Sandhyā passage of the MānGS below pp. 189–192.</p>
<p>648 ŚāṅkhGS IV 17 (tr. Oldenberg, SBE  XXIX: 130–131).</p>
<p>649 ŚāṅkhGS IV 17.5. As the purpose of the ritual is to drive away the “evil” ( pāpman), among the texts that are to be recited, only ṚV I 97 can be said to fit the occasion. The first verse of this hymn shows why it was chosen: “Blazing away the bad for us, blaze wealth here, o Agni, – blazing away the bad for us.” ápa naḥ śóśucad aghám, ágne śuśugdhíy ā́ rayím /</p>

<p>Śrāddha (a ritual performed for the benefit of dead relatives), while the invited Brahmins are eating, the Gṛhastha recites the so-called Madhuvātīya verses, verses dedicated to the Pitṛs and verses to Soma Pavamāna – again, preceded by the three Vyāhṛtis and the GM.⁶⁵⁰ Some texts also generally prescribe its recitation before svādhyāya, the private or individual recitation of the Veda,⁶⁵¹</p>
<p>or before the Veda is taught.⁶⁵² While both the pratyavarohaṇa  and the Śrāddha are comparatively rarely performed, the individual recitation (and for some, teaching) of the Veda was a daily business (and was even done in multiple sessions throughout the day). In ritual practice, the GM was thus quite often recited as the first verse or the first mantra (often preceded, of course, by om  and the Vyāhṛtis, a combination that could in fact be categorized as a mantra itself).</p>
<p>While it is difficult to establish direct causal developments between the various rituals, it seems plausible that they were often influenced by the GM’s prominent position in the Upanayana and the daily Sandhyā: in the former, it features as the first mantra to be learned in one’s lifetime; in the latter, as the most important (and often first) mantra to be recited at the beginning and end of each day. It is clear that every time the GM was used as the first mantra in a sequence, its role as an initiatory mantra was further consolidated. As we will see in the following section, this frequent and typical use of the GM as the first mantra also gave a further impetus to its becoming the foremost  verse of the Vedas. s</p>
<p><strong>3. The foremost Vedic verse</strong></p>
<p>In Chapter 2, we observed that a gāyatrī sāvitrī  was used as an initiation mantra already before the first Gṛhyasūtras came into being.⁶⁵³ There seems to be little reason to assume that this was any mantra other than the GM.⁶⁵⁴ While the Gṛhyasūtras formally treat it as one mantra among others (notwithstanding the fact that it is one of the few mantras with a proper name), they also reflect the status it had already attained before they were composed. In several Gṛhya rituals, oblations are offered to a multitude of entities, including not only deities in the usual sense, but also Ṛṣis and other semi-divine beings along with texts, meters, the ritual itself, heaven and earth, plants, and so forth. These divinities 650 ŚāṅkhGS IV 1.5; cf. Gonda 1980a: 446.</p>

<p>are given in lists which, in a way, represent the totality of the religious cosmos of their authors. The GM features in these lists as the only verse present.</p>
<p>What follows is a presentation of seven of these lists containing the GM, alongside brief introductions to the ritual and textual context, translations of relevant portions, comments on special characteristics, and discussions of their meaning and purport. Particularly instructive is the position of the mantra relative to the other entities in the lists. In several cases, however, I will also clarify whether or not the GM was thought to be more than a divine text, possibly even a deity.</p>
<p>Most prominent among the rituals containing such lists is the Upākaraṇa, the annual ritual which inaugurates the period of study around the beginning of the rainy season.⁶⁵⁵ In the lists used for this ritual, the sāvitrī  is often placed in a position before  the Vedas.</p>
<p>The first example is found in one of the least studied Gṛhyasūtras, the **Baudhāyana-Gṛhyasūtra **(<strong>BaudhGS</strong>).⁶⁵⁶ In this text, a particular ritual sequence is prescribed in various contexts, occasionally with modifications.⁶⁵⁷ This sequence includes the “carving” ( ud+ likh) of a devayajana, a “place of ritual worship for the gods,” on the ground. In this demarcated area, libations to various deities are offered. In the case of the Upākaraṇa, it is generally the teacher who offers libations, not only to divine beings such as Sadasaspati, but also</p>
<p>… to the <strong>sāvitrī</strong>, to this one: “That desirable [splendor] of the Impeller…”. |7|</p>
<p>Next, he offers oblations to the Vedas: “to the Ṛgveda, svāhā; to the Yajurveda, svāhā; to the Sāmaveda, svāhā; to the Atharvaveda, svāhā; to the Atharvans and the Aṅgirases, svāhā; to the Itihāsas and Purāṇas, svāhā; to the serpent gods, svāhā; to all beings, svāhā!” |8|⁶⁵⁸</p>
<p>A very similar (and long) list is found in the Dharmasūtra of the same school, the <strong>BaudhDhS</strong>, where even more entities are to be “quenched” or “satiated” ( tṛp) during the daily morning bath.⁶⁵⁹ The passage is probably a later addition, but shall nevertheless be briefly dealt with here. The performer is the householder:</p>
<p>655 See Kane II(2): 811–815.</p>
<p>656 For this text, see especially Lubin 2016b.</p>
<p>657 See also BaudhGS III 1.4–8; 2.5–11, 17–24, 30–36, 42–49; 3.6–13.</p>

<p>BaudhGS III 1.4–8</p>
<p>659 This bath does not belong to the Sandhyā in the strict sense; cf. Rastelli 2014: 246: “BaudhDhS’s prescriptions for the Twilight worship and the bath overlap in some aspects. They give the impression of describing two independent procedures that partly consist of the same elements rather than two consecutive sequences.”</p>

<p>“om, I satiate … the Humming [i.e., the syllable om] … the Vyāhṛtis …</p>
<p>the **sāvitrī **… the gāyatrī … the meters … the Ṛgveda … the Yajurveda</p>
<p>… the Sāmaveda … the Atharvaveda … the Atharvans and Aṅgirases …</p>
<p>the Itihāsas and Purāṇas … all the Vedas … all the gods and people … all beings.”⁶⁶⁰</p>
<p>In this list, the sāvitrī  is preceded by om  and the Vyāhṛtis. Considering that this list is much more extensive that of the BaudhGS, it is easily understood that these two elements (which are regularly present in the Upanayana) are added.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the sāvitrī  is here also followed by the gāyatrī  and the meters.</p>
<p>Similar practices are also known in other Vedic schools. The <strong>ŚāṅkhGS</strong>, for instance, prescribes a ritual that is most likely performed after the Samāvartana, the conclusion of studentship.⁶⁶¹ While bathing, the ex-student offers libations to a great many entities,⁶⁶² among them “Brahmā, the Vedas, the gods, the Ṛṣis and all meters, the sound om, the sound sequence vaṣaṭ, the Great Vyāhṛtis, the <strong>sāvitrī</strong>, the sacrifices…” Why the ritual utterance vaṣaṭ, well known from Śrauta ritual, is inserted between om  and the Vyāhṛtis is unclear.⁶⁶³ Perhaps the combination of om, the Vyāhṛtis, and the sāvitrī  was not as fixed in this school as in others: the ŚāṅkhGS, for example, does not combine om  or the Vyāhṛtis with the verse in the prescriptions for the initiation ritual.⁶⁶⁴</p>
<p>The fourth list shows that the sāvitrī  was not restricted to being a formulaic prelude to the Vedas. In the prescription for the Upākaraṇa as well as the Utsarga given in the <strong>ĀśvGS</strong>, it is found among yet other abstract concepts and entities.</p>
<p>Here, it is the first one, followed by the brahman (or, possibly, the god Brahmā): 660 oṃ praṇavaṃ tarpayāmi | oṃ vyāhṛtīs tarpayāmi | oṃ sāvitrīṃ tarpayāmi | oṃ gāyatrīṃ</p>

<p>Having offered two ājya  portions, he [i.e., the teacher] is to offer ājya  libations to the <strong>sāvitrī</strong>, the brahman/Brahmā, to faith,⁶⁶⁵ to intelligence, to insight, to concentration, to the Lord of the Seat (Sadasaspati), to assent, to the meters, and to the Ṛṣis.⁶⁶⁶</p>
<p>In the examples given so far, the sāvitrī  is often found near (though not necessarily next to) the Vedas. Some lists, however, also exhibit another peculiarity: in addition to mentioning the sāvitrī  in combination with the Vedas, they conspicuously associate the sāvitrī  with Savitṛ. Three of these passages follow.</p>
<p>According to the rules laid down in the Upākaraṇa section of the **Hiraṇyakeśi-Gṛhyasūtra **(<strong>HirGS</strong>), the teacher is to offer oblations to the deities associated with the five kāṇḍa s of the TaittS or,⁶⁶⁷ alternatively, to the names of the kāṇḍa s themselves (which also contain the names of the deities). Next, he makes offerings to the sāvitrī  and to the four Vedas, and, lastly, to the deity Sadasaspati.⁶⁶⁸ In the same ritual, the teacher and his students also ritually prepare seats of Dharba grass for a great number of divinities. In a long list of Ṛṣis, deities, and divinities, the four Vedas are also mentioned, preceded by Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  and followed by the Itihāsas and Purāṇas:</p>
<p>… to Indra, to Tvaṣtṛ (the Carpenter), to the Maker, to the Upholder, to the Placer, to Death, to <strong>Savitṛ</strong>, to the **sāvitrī ** and to the Vedas: one by one to the Ṛgveda, to the Yajurveda, to the Sāmaveda, to the Atharvaveda, to the Itihāsas and Purāṇas taken together.⁶⁶⁹</p>
<p>Another, similar list is found in the **Bhāradvāja-Gṛhyasūtra **(<strong>BhārGS</strong>), recited in both the Upākaraṇa and Utsarjana. The greatest similarity occurs after Indra is mentioned. Here again, several names and epithets of several obviously very powerful male deities (or one deity?) are given, followed by the sāvitrī: 665 Cf. n. 908 on p. 209 below.</p>

<p>668 Not much is known about this deity, whose name literally means “Lord of the Seat.”</p>

<p>While Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  are not directly adjacent, it is conspicuous that they are only separated by two compounds that could easily be understood as epithets of Savitṛ ( suśravase satyaśravase; note also the alliteration).</p>
<p>In the seventh and last passage to be considered here, the association between Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  appears to be even stronger. According to the <strong>BaudhDhS</strong>, oblations are to be offered to a number of divinities before the complete individual recitation of the Veda (performed while fasting). In the list, which has some similarity with that of the ĀśvGS (III 5.4) given above, several male gods and different types of Vedic texts (masculine) are followed by several abstract entities (feminine), followed in turn by Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  as well as the Lord of the Seat and anumati, “assent” (masculine/feminine in both cases).</p>
<p>This reinforces the impression that they in some way form a couple: To Fire, svāhā; to the Lord of Progeny (Prajāpati), svāhā; to Soma, svāhā; to All Gods, to the Self-Existent One, to the verses of praise ( ṛc), to the ritual formulae ( yajus), to the melodies ( sāman), to the atharvan s (the Atharvavedic formulae), to faith,⁶⁷¹ to insight, to intelligence, to splendor, to modesty, to <strong>Savitṛ</strong>, to the <strong>sāvitrī</strong>, to the Lord of the Seat (Sadasaspati), and to assent.⁶⁷²</p>
<p>In these last three passages, the sāvitrī  is mentioned right after or very near Savitṛ, its eponym. In the first two it is located between the deities and the texts; in the last one, it is located between two deities. It is certainly no coincidence that the sāvitrī  is always found very close to Savitṛ in these lists.</p>
<p>As we approach the turn of the millennium (in fact, the passage from the BaudhDhS translated above most likely dates to the first millennium ce), we 670 BhārGS III 10: viśvāmitrāya jamadagnaye bharadvājāya gautamāyātraye vasiṣṭhāya kaśyapāyārundhatyai kalpayāmīti dakṣiṇato ’gastyāya kalpayanty uttarataḥ kṛṣṇadvaipāyanāya jātūkarṇāya tarukṣāya bṛhadukthāya tṛṇabindave somaśravase somaśuṣmiṇe vājaśravase vājaratnāya varmiṇe varūthine satvavate haryajvane vāmadevāyodamayā-yarṇaṃjayāyartaṃjayāya kṛtaṃjayāya dhanaṃjayāya babhrave tryaruṇāya trivarṣāya tridhātave ’śvayajñāya parāśarāya vasiṣṭhāyendrāya mṛtyave kartre tvaṣṭre dhātre vidhātre savitre suśravase satyaśravase sāvitryai chandobhya ṛgvedāya yajurvedāya sā-mavedāyātharvāṅgirobhya itihāsapurāṇebhyaḥ sarpadevajanebhyaḥ sarvabhūtebhyaś ca kalpayāmīti.</p>

<p>have to be more aware regarding the possibility that the sāvitrī  appears as a deity (even while we are still in the first of part of this study). Even if there are no explicit indications, we must carefully examine each case whether the sāvitrī  could have been thought of as a goddess. As we saw in the preceding chapter,⁶⁷³ the authors of the Gṛhyasūtras were certainly very aware of the etymological and ritual connection between Savitṛ and the sāvitrī. The question is whether this connection was the only reason for their being grouped together in the lists.</p>
<p>Just as the sāvitrī  is often grouped together with the Vedas, it is very likely that the various male names and epithets preceding the texts are somehow associated with each other. While designations such as “maker” or “ordainer” are used as names of specific deities, they are also applicable to any “henotheistic”</p>
<p>or “monotheistic,” supreme creator god.⁶⁷⁴ At the time of the early Gṛhyasūtras, the best candidate for this role would still have been the famous Prajāpati, who could certainly be thought of as a great maker, giver, and ordainer.⁶⁷⁵ Prajāpati was also identified with Savitṛ, who was one of his most important predecessors.⁶⁷⁶ In Part II, I will show that a number of Vedic texts know of a goddess called Sūryā Sāvitrī. This Sāvitrī was not only said to be Savitṛ’s daughter, but also Prajāpati’s.⁶⁷⁷ Yet another text, the JaimUB, one of the earliest Upaniṣads, explicitly calls Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  a couple.⁶⁷⁸ Could it be that, after all, the sāvitrī  in the Gṛhyasūtra list is not only a mantra, but also a goddess, who is in some way related to the previously mentioned male deities?</p>
<p>While this interpretation is tempting, there are several reasons for not accepting it. The word ca “and” in the HirGS passage – the only ca  in a very long list – connects the sāvitrī  with the Vedas,⁶⁷⁹ thus suggesting that, as is usual in texts from this period, the sāvitrī mantra  is meant. This does not rule out that someone could have understood the term as also  referring to a deity. However, the early Gṛhyasūtras nowhere  state or imply that the GM was personified or even deified, nor do they ever explicitly identify it with Sūryā Sāvitrī, the Vedic goddess bearing (almost) the same name.⁶⁸⁰ There is no indication that the authors of the early Gṛhyasūtras and the Dharmasūtras already conceived of the sāvitrī  as a goddess.</p>
<p>Similar uncertainties surround Sāvitrī’s potential father or partner. The various designations in the lists certainly could be interpreted as manifestations 673 See, in particular, above p. 121.</p>
<p>674 Cf. Andrijanić 2018.</p>
<p>675 For this deity, see especially Gonda 1982 and 1986.</p>

<p>or aspects of a universal creator god, a conception that had already emerged in the Vedic period. But this deity is not explicitly called Prajāpati in the lists. If he really was thought to be Sāvitrī’s father (or more precisely, the father of the goddess Sāvitrī identified with the sāvitrī  mantra), there would have been no reason to conceal his name. The most plausible explanation is that Savitṛ and the sāvitrī  were simply associated with each other because of their etymological relationship and phonetic similarity. This is corroborated by the observation that there are even more alliterations in the lists of the BhārGS ( savitre suśravase satyaśravase sāvitryai) and the BaudhDhS ( savitre sāvitryai sadasaspataye).</p>
<p>What the lists discussed above have illustrated, however, is that elaborate personification is not necessary in order to become a divinity, or at least an object of religious worship. As we saw last, the sāvitrī – or, returning to the standard usage in this study, the GM – was neither personified nor deified.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the passages reveal much about the status the GM had in Early Hinduism. We observe that it usually precedes the Vedas. Given that it is the first Vedic mantra to be learned, this is only natural. What is significant, however, is that this position also places it “on a par” with the entire Vedic corpus.</p>
<p>While other frequently heard sonic entities, such as om, the Vyāhṛtis, vaṣaṭ, and the meters, are also occasionally present, the GM is the only verse to be found in the lists. This shows that it enjoyed a special status among Vedic verses in general: the status of being the Vedic verse par excellence, one might say. As we will see in the following, calling it such is by no means an exaggeration. The GM could, in some cases, even stand in for the entire Veda, in theory as well as in practice.</p>

<p>The Gṛhya- and Dharmasūtra passages discussed above are the earliest sources informing us about the high status of the GM in the religious cosmos. But the GM was not only raised to be on a par with the other Vedas, it even became their “epitome” – a word which has no direct equivalent in the Sanskrit sources, but whose usage, as we shall see, is fully justified. This can be observed on the practical as well as on the ideological or “theological” level.</p>
<p>On the practical level, it was in some cases possible to substitute the recitation of (parts of) the Vedas with the recitation of the GM. Probably the earliest evidence for this practice is found in the <strong>TaittĀ</strong>, where individual recitation of the Veda is prescribed as a kind of remedy against the exhaustion resulting</p>
<p>160 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>from acting as a priest (and receiving payment for it).⁶⁸¹ The text of the passage is corrupt and difficult to understand, and I will only try to give an approximate translation:</p>
<p>Verily, he who officiates at a sacrifice or receives payment becomes, as it were, empty, almost over-empty. Having officiated at a sacrifice or having received payment, he should thrice – privately and while fasting – recite the Veda. Alternatively, for three days [literally “nights”] he should pro-long⁶⁸² [the recitation of] the sāvitrī gāyatrī.⁶⁸³</p>
<p>In this case, the repetition of the GM is a ritual equivalent for the recitation of Vedic texts. What “reciting the Veda thrice” encompasses is not specified, but at any rate, three days of reciting the same mantra probably was not meant to save time. What we can conclude from this passage is that the GM was not recited because of any of its own properties as a text, but because of its special relationship to the Veda as a whole.</p>
<p>Another early example shows that the GM could also be used to make up for a lack of knowledge. The example is found in the <strong>ŚāṅkhGS</strong>. The text prescribes that, before the teaching of the Veda, the teacher should be asked to recite the GM as well as the names of its Ṛṣi (Viśvāmitra), its deity (Savitṛ), and its meter ( gāyatrī). In this way, he should teach the Ṛṣi, deity, and meter of every mantra. In the unfortunate case that he does not recall this paratextual (or “para-mantric”) data, there is a stopgap:</p>
<p>Or, when not recalling the Ṛṣi, the dedication to the deity, and the meter, the teacher recites this: “That desirable [splendor] of the Impeller…,”</p>
<p>pāda  by pāda, hemistich by hemistich, [and then finally] without pausing; having finished, [he recites or explains] “this… [verse belongs to Savitṛ</p>
<p>etc.].”⁶⁸⁴</p>
<p>681 For this passage, see also Lubin 2005: 89–90. The idea here appears to be that acting as a priest and receiving payment for it causes impurity; individual recitation is, therefore, a means of expiation and purification.</p>
<p>682 Malamoud 1977: 197: “Littéralement: on fait en sort que la gāyatrī dépasse à la suite (d’elle-même), d’est-à-dire qu’elle se prolonge.” This might mean that the recitation of the GM at the beginning of a svādhyāya  session should be prolonged.</p>

<p>In general, however, the complete  substitution of Vedic recitation with the GM in ritual practice was restricted to more or less isolated instances, or even</p>
<p>“makeshift solutions,” such as those shown here.⁶⁸⁵</p>
<p>More significantly, the GM was also made the representative of the Vedas on a “theological” level. Several texts explain that the GM was, in one way or another, “extracted” from all the Vedas. The earliest among them is probably the <strong>MānDhŚ</strong>, where many of the aspects of the GM discussed in this chapter reappear:⁶⁸⁶</p>
<p>The sound “a,” the sound “u,” and the sound “m” – Prajāpati milked them out of the three Vedas, as also “eaRth, inteRspace, sKy.” /76/</p>
<p>From the three Vedas, Prajāpati, the Supreme Being, milked out foot after foot of this sāvitrī  verse: “That…” /77/</p>
<p>Softly reciting this syllable and this (verse), preceded by the Vyāhṛtis, at the junctures, a Brahmin who knows the Veda wins the merit of the Veda</p>
<p>[i.e., of reciting the Veda itself]. /78/</p>
<p>By exercising these three one thousand times outside [the village], a twice-born is freed from even a grievous sin within a month, like a snake from its slough. /79/</p>
<p>Someone who is a Brahmin, a Kṣatriya, or a Vaiśya by birth invites the censure of good people by disconnecting himself from this verse and from</p>
<p>[the performance of] his ritual at the right time. /80/</p>
<p>The imperishable three Great Vyāhṛtis, preceded by the sound om, and the three-footed sāvitrī  should be recognized as the mouth [i.e., the principal part] of the brahman. /81/</p>
<p>When someone recites this [ sāvitrī] tirelessly everyday for three years, having become wind and having the form of the air,⁶⁸⁷ he reaches the highest brahman. /82/</p>
<p>The highest brahman  is the single syllable [i.e., om], the highest ascetic toil 685 For an example in a much later text, the Garuḍa-Purāṇa (GarP), see Hikita 2005: 162.</p>
<p>Cf. also KūrmP II 14.50: “The Lord weighed the weight of the Gāyatrī(-Mantra) and the Vedas: on one side, the four Vedas, on the other, the Gāyatrī(-Mantra).” gāyatrīṃ caiva vedāṃś ca tulayātolayat prabhuḥ / ekataś caturo vedān gāyatrīṃ ca tathaikataḥ //; or AVPar XLI 4.5: “One should softly recite a hundred Gāyatrīs on a rosary in the evening and morning; one certainly obtains the full result of the four Vedas.” gāyatryā akṣamālāyāṃ</p>

<p>686 A peculiarity of this passage, which has not been made the subject of discussion so far, is the praise of the syllable om, a syllable whose significance in South Asian religions has long been known, but which only recently has begun to receive the scholarly attention it deserves; see Gerety 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p>687 This probably refers to the disembodiment of the soul or self after death.</p>

<p>is the control of breath, nothing is higher than the sāvitrī; truth is better than silence. /83/⁶⁸⁸</p>
<p>For the greater part, I believe, this passage speaks for itself. Prajāpati, the</p>
<p>“Lord of Progeny,” extracted the three pāda s of the GM from the three traditional Vedas (Ṛg-, Yajur-, Sāma-). The GM can, therefore, be understood to be their essence. Together with its frequent introductory formula, the syllable om  and the Vyāhṛtis, the GM is the mukha  of the Vedas, that is, its “mouth, entrance, face” or, less literally, its “main” or “principal part.” Every dvija  has to recite it, and reciting it at the Sandhyā amounts to reciting the entire Veda. Thus, in this short passage many important aspects of the GM above are present: its social importance as the defining characteristic of dvija s is alluded to; its recitation in the Sandhyā is mentioned; and lastly, it is characterized as the essence or main part of the Veda, that is, its epitome.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Compressing the Vedas</strong></p>
<p>As we can see, between the earliest Gṛhyasūtras and the MānDhŚ, which was composed several centuries later,⁶⁸⁹ the GM in many ways became the first and foremost formula of the Vedas, and even its epitome. While we can retrace this development on various levels, why it continued in this way over the course of several centuries is not self-explanatory. What drove this development for so long? What caused it to assume this role? To answer these questions, it is necessary to return to the question of how Brahminism emerged and by which authority it legitimized itself.</p>
<p>The Vedas were (and are) the ideological hallmark of Brahminical authority. In formulating the Dharmasūtras, the Brahmin authors invoked the Vedas as their ultimate authority and legitimization. In fact, of course, “the Vedas” (that is, in the strictest sense, the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas)⁶⁹⁰ have little to say about Dharma as such. The source of the Brahminical Dharma was only ostensibly the Vedic texts, but in fact the true source was the customs and traditions of 688 MānDhŚ II 76–83: akāraṃ cāpy ukāraṃ ca makāraṃ ca prajāpatiḥ vedatrayān niraduhad bhūr bhuvaḥ svar itīti ca /76/ tribhya eva tu vedebhyaḥ pādaṃ pādam adūduhat / tad ity ṛco</p>

<p>those Brahmins who codified the Dharma.⁶⁹¹ Nevertheless, the Vedas became the most important cultural symbol of Brahminism, and access to them was only granted to those who had been duly initiated.</p>
<p>However, as the knowledge of and permission to recite Vedic texts formally were made the hallmark of the entire upper stratum of society,⁶⁹² a solution had to be found for all those who would never engage in the arduous study of Vedic texts. Obviously, inaugurating the memorization of thousands of mantras could no longer remain the general objective of the ritual. While many of the new initiates probably learned more than just one Vedic verse, only few would continue to dedicate themselves entirely to the preservation of the Vedic heritage: the Brahmins in the original sense of the word.⁶⁹³</p>
<p>It is difficult to reconstruct how many Vedic mantras Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas really learned throughout the centuries. Considering that they were primarily to acquire skills and competencies of a completely different nature, it is very likely that the study of Vedic texts was in many cases only a minor part of their education.⁶⁹⁴ In modern times, the period of studentship is sometimes even compressed to a few hours.⁶⁹⁵ It is yet unknown when exactly this process of compression started and how it developed. What we can infer, however, is that it must have been very conducive to the GM’s becoming the epitome of the Vedas.</p>
<p>For a great number of non-Brahmin dvija s – who were allowed  to recite, but not obliged  to learn as many Vedic mantras as possible – the GM in practice was probably of the one of the few, perhaps even the only Vedic mantra they ever learned.⁶⁹⁶ The idea that this mantra must, therefore, be the most important and most representative of all Vedic mantras, is then only natural. The nexus between the GM and the Vedas, already established by way of the Upanayana, could thus become even stronger. In a way, the GM even became more than just the essence of the Veda. As Malamoud put it:</p>
<p>The sāvitrī  is indeed an actual stanza of the Ṛksaṃhitā, a piece, therefore, taken from the body of the Veda, not the reduced image of the Veda or the quintessence of the Veda. The sāvitrī  is rather the minimal Veda, and like an emblem of Vedism.⁶⁹⁷</p>

<p>696 The late VaikhGS VIII 3 (tr. Caland 1929: 185), for instance, mentions a so-called gāyatra brahmacārin, who only remains a brahmacārin  for three days after his initiation.</p>
<p>697 Translation of Malamoud 1977: 89: “[L]a sāvitrī  est en effet une stance réelle de la R̥kSaṃhitā, un morceau, donc, prélevé sur le corps du Veda, non l’image réduite du Veda</p>
<p>164 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>As we saw above, the rise of the GM certainly started in the Brahminical milieu itself: it could even substitute the recitation of the Veda in two rituals performed by the most exemplary of Brahmins, a priest and a teacher. Once established, however, the extension of the Upanayana and the concomitant extension of the teaching of the GM must have fed back to the system that had brought it about. Put simply: when non-specialists began to view the GM as the epitome of the Vedas, Brahmins trained in the Vedas, too, became more inclined to think of it as such.</p>
<p><strong>5. Purification and social identity</strong></p>
<p>In the preceding sections, we observed how the GM became the foremost verse of the Vedas. In this section, we will turn to the emergence of a practice that, I would argue, is a consequence of the developments discussed above. This practice is the recitation of the GM for the purpose of ritual purification.</p>
<p>In many cases, ritual purification involved repeated recitation, a practice that later came to be known as japa. While this kind of japa  is nowadays well known, in the earliest stages of Hinduism, it had not yet become a common practice. As far as I can tell, it first emerged during the time of the Dharmasūtras.⁶⁹⁸</p>
<p>In the prescriptions of these texts, if a mantra is to be recited repetitively (i.e., one hundred times or more), it is in the vast majority of cases the GM – and no other mantra.⁶⁹⁹ The purpose of this practice is almost always to maintain or restore the ritual purity of the reciter.</p>
<p>In Hinduism, the axis of purity and impurity – not only in a physical, but also in a ritual and social sense – plays a major role.⁷⁰⁰ Impurity is not only caused by external pollution, but also by committing “sinful” acts. A “sin” ( pāpa) is something that has negative soterial, social, and/or ritual effects.⁷⁰¹ States of sinfulness, too, are conceptualized along the axis of purity and impurity: the graver the sin, the graver the impurity. Since purity is demanded in most ritual contexts, impure substances and persons are not allowed to be part of any kind of ritual. Impurity also has social consequences: someone who has become im-</p>

<p>ou la quintessence du Veda. La sāvitrī  est plutôt le Veda minimal, et comme l’emblème du védisme.”</p>
<p>698 For examples, see Gonda 1980a: 228–229. The practice is rarely mentioned in the Gṛhyasūtras; see, for instance, BaudhGS II 9.4 and JaimGS II 6. Later, the practice is also combined with fire-offerings; cf. Einoo 2005a: 47–48.</p>
<p>699 This assessment is based on my (certainly not exhaustive) reading of the extant Dharmasūtras; more research on the emergence of repetitive mantra recitation is needed.</p>
<p>700 See generally Malinar 2009 and 2018.</p>
<p>701 See Brick 2018: 314. As Kellner (2020: 39, n. 2) pointed out, the term “soterial” is preferable to the term “soteriological” in contexts such as the present one.</p>
<p>chapteR 5 ∙ status in eaRly hinduism ∙ 165</p>
<p>pure can even be prohibited entirely from engaging with other, comparatively purer, persons.⁷⁰²</p>
<p>There are, however, several means to re-establish ritual purity.⁷⁰³ The Dharmasūtras describe many kinds of prāyaścitta s (“penances”) as well as pavitra s (“means of purification”), whose purpose is to remove sin and to restore purity. The recitation of the GM features prominently among them.</p>
<p>Thus, the GM is listed, alongside others, as one of the so-called pāvana s or</p>
<p>“purificatory” texts.⁷⁰⁴ The Sūtras prescribe its recitation in a number of cases: it is recited if someone has spoken with an outcaste,⁷⁰⁵ if one was asleep at sunrise,⁷⁰⁶ or if one has survived an attempt at suicide.⁷⁰⁷ If a broken pot is replaced by a new one, one should recite the GM several times, obviously to purify it (and oneself).⁷⁰⁸ The GM should be repeated as often as possible if a mistake is committed during the teaching or recitation of the Veda.⁷⁰⁹ Bathing and reciting it 1,000 times, with or without breath control, is given as one of several prāyaścitta s for “studying in the wrong way” ( mithyādhīta).⁷¹⁰ It should also be recited 1,000 times as an (obviously easier) alternative for penances for severe sins unknown to the public.⁷¹¹ If a wife commits adultery in her mind, in words, or in deed, she has to undergo various penances, and the husband has to offer ghee into the fire 800, 3,200, or 8,000 times, reciting the GM together with the so-called Śiras formula.⁷¹² Elsewhere, it is also said that by reciting it 8,000 times (or just three times)⁷¹³ at sunrise, a man is freed from all sins.⁷¹⁴</p>
<p>But why the GM? As a young student, an ārya  learns how to keep himself pure, both in the physical as well as in a ritual sense. The concept of purity even becomes ingrained in his personal and social identity. In the Brahminical system, the (male) dvija s of the three classes are considered purer than all 702 See Malinar 2009: 36–38.</p>

<p>others,⁷¹⁵ the Brahmins being the purest.⁷¹⁶ Non- dvija s, on the other hand, are characterized by impurity: they are either Śūdras, untouchables, or foreigners.</p>
<p>For a dvija, becoming polluted therefore also means moving towards the other end of the purity–impurity axis, that is, becoming more like someone who in the social hierarchy is below him.⁷¹⁷ Even if the status of being a dvija  itself is ultimately not lost that easily, pollution constantly threatens to diminish it.</p>
<p>Above we saw that a person becomes a dvija  through his second birth in the Upanayana. One of the most important components of this ritual is the teaching of a sāvitrī, in most cases, the GM.⁷¹⁸ As the mantra that makes a person a dvija  in the first place, the GM is also well suited to restore this status whenever it is diminished. Obviously, it is not used in prāyaścitta s because its meaning as a text or its other ritual applications are connected with purification. Rather, it was felt to have the power to renew the socio-ritual identity of its reciter. By way of extension, this logic was also applied in the case of objects: as mentioned above, a pot can be purified by reciting the GM, the number of repetitions depending on the status of its donor. The fact that the GM is, in practice, among the foremost purificatory texts is thus easily explained.</p>
<p>As I alluded to above, it is likely that the practice of reciting the GM as a prāyaścitta  and its repetition in the Sandhyā (which originally only consisted in the recitation of a sāvitrī) are related. Considering that the early Gṛhyasūtras –</p>
<p>the texts containing the instructions for the Sandhyā – are probably somewhat older than the Dharmasūtras,⁷¹⁹ this ritual may have been the source of inspiration for the specific practice of repeating the GM as a prāyaścitta. This does not preclude, however, that this repetition could not function as  a prāyaścitta. On the contrary, the entire Sandhyā is probably better understood as an obligatory prāyaścitta  rather than as an actual worship of the junctures, or twilights.⁷²⁰</p>
<p>715 See Malinar 2009: 36–38.</p>
<p>716 This is not so much because they are  always pure, but because they have the power and means to purify themselves; see Malinar 2009: 23–27.</p>
<p>717 According to Olivelle (2012b: 240), in Dharma literature, “we see no instance when a term for pure/impure is used with reference to a group of individuals or to a Varṇa or caste, the only exception being people who have fallen from their caste due to grievous sins; these are often called aśuci.” Belonging to a particular social group or class is no guarantee of purity; rather, purity must be maintained in order not to be excluded from the system in the first place.</p>
<p>718 See above pp. 144–146.</p>
<p>719 The earliest Dharmasūtra, the ĀpDhS, probably dates to the third century bce (Olivelle 2018a: 21); the start of the production of Gṛhyasūtras is generally (though not by all scholars) placed somewhat earlier; see n. 465 on p. 112 above.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This chapter has demonstrated that the status of the GM was significantly up-graded during the early phase of Hinduism. Apart from the obvious significance of an initiation mantra and its role as the first mantra among thousands to follow (the “ABC” of an endless “alphabet” of mantras), cultural and social developments, too, contributed to its rise (see <strong>Section 1</strong>). When the Upanayana was extended and was made a rite of passage for all ārya s, it became compulsory to be initiated with a sāvitrī. While other sāvitrī s were sometimes used, the GM remained the most important among them, especially because it was used by the Brahmins, who were the certainly the most active ritual performers. Its position in the Upanayana ensured that it could reappear again and again as one of the symbols of the Vedas and, therefore, of “orthodox” Hinduism (see Figure 5).</p>

<p>**Figure 5: **The development of the status of the GM in Early Hinduism However, as we saw in <strong>Section 2</strong>, it did not simply remain the first Vedic verse to be learned, but also became the first mantra to be recited in the daily life of brahmacārin s and, in the course of time, of householders as well. Reciting the GM was an essential (and the only original) component of the Sandhyā.</p>
<p>I have proposed that at the very beginning, the recitation of the GM in this this ritual might have been a simple exercise for young students, who at the commencement of their studentship could not even recite any other mantra.</p>
<p>168 ∙ paRt i ∙ the mantRa</p>
<p>Additionally – and this was probably much more significant – it could also function as a daily “reminder” of one’s new social status and as a means to preserving that status. As such, its purpose was essentially purificatory, which also explains why it was later combined with a number of other (mostly) purificatory rituals acts. In this function, it also became popular outside the Sandhyā, namely as a prāyaścitta, a private religious practice whose purpose is to purify the reciter from sins.⁷²¹ This use is first mentioned in the Dharmasūtras, which are presumably somewhat younger than the earliest Gṛhyasūtras. It is possible that the (repetitive) recitation of the GM as a prāyaścitta  historically goes back to the Sandhyā; however, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions.</p>
<p>The term sandhyopāsana  was probably not understood as “worship of the Sandhyā.” The idea that the juncture or twilight itself is the object of worship is, to my knowledge, never explicitly stated in the early sources. A mythical or etiological background for the ritual was, in any case, only provided after it had already existed for some time. The “Sandhyā myth,” found in two late-Vedic (or rather, post-Vedic) texts, the ṢaḍvB and the TaittĀ, explains that its ultimate purpose is to help the sun rise. Significantly, however, neither of the two texts place any emphasis on the GM. A connection to the time of the early morning by way of Savitṛ and/or his manifestation as the sun is possible, but cannot be backed up with evidence. As I have suggested, however, this connection might have simply been too obvious, and there might have been little need to elaborate on what is more or less self-explanatory.</p>
<p>However it originated, the Sandhyā became one of the most regularly performed rituals. It is easily understood that the daily recitation of the GM during this ritual (be it once, thrice, or more often) must have made a great impact on the minds of the reciters. As a matter of fact, it was also used as the first mantra in a sequence in several other Gṛhya rituals.⁷²² Every time the GM was used in this way, its role as an initiatory mantra was further consolidated. Above all others, however, it must have been the daily Sandhyā that functioned as an excellent “amplifier” of the GM, especially when we take into account that it eventually became part of a householder’s daily ritual routine as well.</p>
<p>In <strong>Section 3</strong>, we saw that several Gṛhya rituals reflect the status the GM</p>
<p>had already attained before these rituals were codified. In the lists of entities worthy of worship,⁷²³ the GM is the only verse. It appears both in the company of the three Vedas and without them. Despite its occasional association with Savitṛ, it does not appear as a deity itself. Nevertheless, it was evidently thought to be in some way divine, otherwise it would not have made much sense to 721 See pp. 164–166.</p>

<p>worship it. Its high status in the religious universe is also indicated by the fact that it is mentioned alongside the Vedas, thus being placed on a par with them.⁷²⁴</p>
<p>In ritual practice, in some cases it became possible to substitute the GM for the recitation of Vedic texts. Most importantly, however, this aspect of the GM</p>
<p>was also reflected on the theological level: since around the beginning of the Common Era, the GM has been thought to be the essence of the Vedas (see <strong>Section 4</strong>).⁷²⁵ While this idea clearly became a common part of Brahminism, I have suggested that here again, the extension of the Upanayana to non-Brahmins might have played a role: with this extension, the permission to recite Vedic texts formally was made the hallmark of the entire upper stratum of society.</p>
<p>The new initiates, however, often did not learn a great number of texts. On the contrary: many probably did not learn more than the very first mantra. While the “condensation” of the Vedas in the GM may have started independently in the Brahminical milieu itself, the role it came to play for those who would never engage in extensive Vedic study probably gave further impetus to this development.⁷²⁶</p>
<p>724 See pp. 159–164.</p>
<p>725 The GM’s status has continued to manifest itself in numerous ways up to the present day.</p>
<p>For example, several sixteenth-century commentators of the Rām. considered the Epic</p>
<p>“both physically and spiritually a grand expansion and exposition of the famous and widely revered and recited ṛc, Ṛgveda  3.62.10” Goldman &amp; Sutherland Goldman 2016: 187. The mantra was mapped onto the text by locating each of its twenty-four syllables in the various parts of the text. The purpose of this strategy was to invest the Epic with Vedic authority – authority that was condensed in the essence of the Vedas, the GM.</p>
<p>726 This, in turn, might have been one of the reasons why medieval commentators such as Sāyaṇa insisted on “interpreting the traditional injunction to study the Veda as pertain-ing to the complete  textual body of one’s family Veda” Galewicz 2009: 256; emphasis mine.</p>
