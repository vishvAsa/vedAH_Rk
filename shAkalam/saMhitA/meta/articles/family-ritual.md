A short note on rituals based on Rigveda.pdf. RV in its present form is predominantly a family book collection (admittedly a simplification of state of affairs). Consolidation of the family maNDalas and Kuru-Pāñchāla śrauta standardization, by definition is a later evolution.

Yeah, there are multiple mantras to erect a yūpa, to kindle agni, for sāvitri. But the name implies they're meant for the clansmen. A vishvāmitra mantra isn't meant for random nobodies and not even v1s of different clans.

A most important aspect of vaidika yajña is the connection to the ancestors. The āpri sūktas and gotra recitation amply testifies to this. You recite the name of Rishi ancestors to indicate that you're a worthy descendant of the great fathers for whom Agni was favorable, And remind him to be as favorable now. This is the reason Kshatriyas and Vaishyas use V1 proxy, having forgotten their own real gotra.+++(5)+++

Unless RV.pdf ritual reconstuctors are deluded in thinking a Vishvāmitra or vasiṣṭa is their real forefather, there's no primordial agni connection. The performance is just mimetic with lots of noise.

> Once RV.pdf for compiled, all mantras (eg. vaishvAmitra sAvitrI) became common property, and not clan-exclusive?

RV consolidation is later than the family books no? So the eligibility to draw from the common book is from a later śrauta evolution which the reconstructor isn't willing to acknowledge. It's only due to the eligibility from tradition, we even offer tarpanas To "our fathers, the bhŕgus, the atharvans, the navagvas.." during pitŕ tarpaņam.



> a question I would have, and this might potentially be off-base, is whether the necessary step of the Nyasa of the Rsi is in some way related to this - of course, the (legit) Diksha for element means connexion *is* there (& thus one is *able* to 'emplace' Rsi for the thing?) 

This is an interesting angle which I haven't considered. There's a direct statement in the brahmanas underscoring the importance of remembering the Chandas and the Rishi. This is the root of mantra nyAsa that extends to tantric mantras.

Then again the tantric mantras aren't deployed in isolation. You get initiated into a sampradAya and are supposed to remember and offer tarpanam the teacher lineage that goes back to the deity who often is the original teacher. In that sense, you do have connection to the original Rishi/deity via the teacher lineage which is analogous to parental lineage to the remote Rishi in Shrauta rituals. Just realized that the importance of sampradAya is well conserved feature into modern Hinduism.
