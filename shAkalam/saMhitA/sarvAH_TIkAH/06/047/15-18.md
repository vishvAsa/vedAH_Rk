As noted in the published introduction, this section, which concerns Indra’s fickle attentions to various clients in turn, is marked grammatically by āmreḍitas and intensives (i.e., iterative/frequentatives), expressing the constantly shifting nature of the actions and their objects. See the published introduction. for the continuity of content I see in this section.
