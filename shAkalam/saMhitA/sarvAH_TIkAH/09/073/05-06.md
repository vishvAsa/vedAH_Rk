These two vss., almost in the center of the hymn, have a similar structure.

Their first pādas are nearly identical: ABL ABL ádhy ā́yé samásvaran “Those who sounded in unison from X X.” The second pādas simply further describe the unspecified subject of the first pādas, while their second hemistichs present what happens to evil beings as a result of the sounding in unison of the first. See also Oldenberg on the symmetry of the vss. and how this affects their interpr.
