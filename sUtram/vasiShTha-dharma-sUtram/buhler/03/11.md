11. An elephant made of wood, an antelope made of leather, and a Brāhmaṇa ignorant of the Veda, those three have nothing but the name (of their kind). [^9] 


[^9]:  Manu II, 157. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita and MS. B. give the ungrammatical construction which occurs in Manu and other Dharmaśāstras, while the other MSS. read more correctly, 'yaśca kāṣṭhamayo h. yaśca carmamayo m.' &c.
