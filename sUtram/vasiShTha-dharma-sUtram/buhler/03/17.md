17. 'He may slay an assassin who comes with the intention of slaying, even though he knows the whole Veda together with the Upaniṣads; by that (act) he (does) not (incur the guilt of) the slayer of a Brāhmaṇa.' [^12] 


[^12]:  I read with the majority of the MSS., 'api vedāntapāragam,' instead of 'vedāntagaṃ raṇe,' as Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita has.
