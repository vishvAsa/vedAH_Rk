3. '(A twice-born man) who does not know the [^3]  Veda (can)not be (called) a Brāhmaṇa, nor he who lives by trade, nor he who (lives as) an actor, nor he who obeys a Śūdra's commands, nor (he who like) a thief (takes the property of others), nor he who makes his living by the practice of medicine.'


[^3]:  This and the following nine verses are, as the word 'iti,' which the best MSS. give at the end of Sūra 12, quotations. p. 17 Anṛk, 'who does not know the Veda,' means, literally, 'unacquainted with the Rig-veda.'
