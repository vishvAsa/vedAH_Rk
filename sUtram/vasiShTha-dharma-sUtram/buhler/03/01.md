1. (Brāhmaṇas) who neither study nor teach the Veda nor keep sacred fires become equal to Śūdras; [^1] 


[^1]:  III. I read Śūdrasadharmāṇaḥ, 'equal to Śūdras,' instead of śūdrakarmāṇaḥ, which occurs in MS. B. only. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita explains the latter reading by śūdravatkarma yeshu te śūdravatteṣvācaraṇīyamityarthaḥ, 'shall be treated like Śūdras.' But the verses quoted in the following Sūtras show that the former reading is the better one.
