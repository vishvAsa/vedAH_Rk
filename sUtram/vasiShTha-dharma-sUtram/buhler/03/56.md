56. But land becomes pure, according to the degree of defilement, by sweeping (the defiled spot), by smearing it with cowdung, by scraping it, by sprinkling (water) or by heaping (pure earth) on (it). [^39] 


[^39]:  Viṣṇu XXIII, 56-57. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita takes upacaraṇa, 'heaping (pure earth) on (the defiled spot),' to mean 'lighting a fire on it' or 'digging it up.' The translation given above rests on the parallel passages of Gautama I, 32, and of Baudhāyana I, 5, 52, bhūmes tu saṃmārjanaprokṣaṇopalepanāvastaraṇopalekhanairyathāsthānaṃ doṣaviśeṣāt prāyatyam, 'land becomes pure, according to the degree of the defilement, by sweeping the (defiled) spot, by sprinkling it, by smearing it with cowdung, by scattering (pure earth) on it, or by scraping it.' Bhūmi, 'land,' includes also the mud-floor of a house or of a verandah.
