20. (Four students of) the four Vedas, one who knows the Mīmāṃsā, one who knows the Aṅgas, a teacher of the sacred law, and three eminent men who are in three (different) orders, (compose) a (legal) assembly consisting at least of ten (members). [^14] 


[^14]:  Manu XII, 111. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita reads cāturvidyas trikalpī ca, 'one who knows the four Vedas and one who knows three different Kalpa-sūtras.' My translation, follows the reading of the MSS., cāturvidyaṃ vikalpī ca, which is corroborated by the parallel passage of Baudhāyana I, 1, 8, 'cāturvaidyaṃ vikalpī ca.' The explanation of the latter word is derived from Govindasvāmin. 'Men who are in three orders, i.e. a student, a householder, and ascetic,' see Gautama XXVIII, 49.
