10. 'The offence of neglecting a Brāhmaṇa cannot be committed against a twice-born man who is ignorant of the Veda. For (in offering sacrifices) one does not pass by a brilliant fire and throw the oblations into ashes.' [^8] 


[^8]:  A learned Brāhmaṇa resembles a sacrificial fire, see e.g. below, XXX, 2-3; Āpastamba I, 1, 3, 44.
