10. The four Pākayajñas and those sacrifices which are enjoined by the rules of the Veda are all together not equal in value to the sixteenth part of a sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers. [^9] 


[^9]:  Identical with Manu II, 86, and Viṣṇu LV, 20. Regarding the four Pākayajñas, see Professor Jolly's note on Viṣṇu. In my opinion the four classes of rites huta, ahuta, prahuta, and prāśita are meant.
