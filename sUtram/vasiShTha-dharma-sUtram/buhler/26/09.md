9. An offering consisting of muttered prayers is ten times more efficacious than a sacrifice at which animals are killed; a (prayer) which is inaudible (to others) surpasses it a hundred times, and the mental (recitation of sacred texts) one thousand times. [^8] 


[^8]:  Manu II, 85; Viṣṇu LV, 19. The term ārambhayajña, translated by 'an offering at which animals are slain,' is taken by Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita to mean pāthayajña, 'an offering consisting of Vedic mantras recited aloud.' The word may be taken in several ways, but the various reading vidhiyajña in Manu's verse induces me to adopt the translation given above.
