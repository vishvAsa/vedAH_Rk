12. The sins of those who are intent on muttering prayers, of those who offer burnt-oblations, of those who are given to meditation, of those who reside in sacred places, and of those who have bathed after performing the vows called Śiras, do not remain. [^11] 


[^11]:  'After performing the vows (called) Śiras,' i.e. those which are known in the Upaniṣads, which are called agnidhāraṇa and so forth, and whose head (śiras) consists in the worship of the teacher: Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita. Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad III, 2, 10.
