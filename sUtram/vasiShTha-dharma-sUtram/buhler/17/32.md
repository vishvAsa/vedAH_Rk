32. 'Hariścandra, forsooth, was a king. He bought the son of Ajīgarta Sauyavasi. [^26] 


[^26]:  The MSS. and editions read the last word of the Sūtra as follows: B. vikrīyya; Ben. ed. vikrīya; Bh. E. F. vikrādya; Calc. ed. and I. O. 913 vikrāyya svayaṃ krītavān. I believe that, as the letters ca and va are constantly mistaken by the copyists the one for the other, the original reading was cikrāya. Regarding the story told in this Sūtra and continued below, Sūtra 35, see Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, pp. 408-416 and 573-588.
