35. 'Sunaḥśepa, forsooth, when tied to the sacrificial stake, praised the gods; there the gods loosened his bonds. To him poke (each of) the officiating priests, "He shall be my son." He did not agree to their (request. Then) they made him make (this) agreement, "He shall be the son of him whom he chooses." Viśvāmitra was the Hotṛ priest at that (sacrifice). He became his son.'
