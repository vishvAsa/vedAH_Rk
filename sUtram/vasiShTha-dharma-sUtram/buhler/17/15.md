15. The third is an appointed daughter. [^14] 


[^14]:  Colebrooke V, Dig. CCIII; Mitākṣarā I, 11, 3; Vyavahāra Mayūkha IV, 4, 43. The curious fact that Vasiṣṭha here calls the appointed daughter a son may perhaps be explained by a custom which, though rarely practised, still occurs in Kaśmīr, and by which a brotherless maiden is given a male name. A historical instance of this kind is mentioned in the Rājataraṅgiṇī, where it is stated that Kalyāṇadevī, princess of Gauḍa and wife of king Jayāpīḍa, was called by her father Kalyāṇamalla. When I collated this passage with the help of a Kaśmīrian, I was told that a certain Brāhmaṇa, still living in Śrinagar, had changed the p. 86 name of his only child, a daughter called Amrī, to the corresponding masculine form, Amarjū, in order to secure to himself through her the same spiritual benefits as if he had a son. It seems to me not improbable that Vasiṣṭha's Sūtra alludes to the same legal fiction, and that he recommends in the first instance that the father is to make his daughter a son by changing her name, and next to secure for himself her son, by the verse quoted Sūtra 17.
