65. No appointment (shall be made) through a desire to obtain the estate. [^45] 


[^45]:  Colebrooke, Mitākṣarā II, 1, 11. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita thinks that the Sūtra forbids an appointment which is made with the intention to secure the estate or a share of the estate of the natural father, from whom the kṣetraja son inherits also (Yājñavalkya II, 127). But it seems equally probable that it is intended to pre-vent a widow from agreeing to an appointment in order to obtain control over her husband's estate.
