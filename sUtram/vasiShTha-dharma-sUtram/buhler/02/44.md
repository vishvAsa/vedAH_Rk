44. Gold (taking) double (its value on repayment, and) grain trebling (the original price). [^24] 


[^24]:  -47. Viṣṇu VI, 11-17; Colebrooke I, Dig. LXVI, where 'silver and gems' have been added after gold, and rasāḥ, 'flavouring substances,' been translated by 'fluids.' The translation differs also in other respects, because there the Sūtras stand by themselves, while here the nouns in Sūtras 44 and 47 are governed by the preceding dadyātām, 'they may lend.' They, i.e. a Brāhmaṇa p. 15 and a Kṣatriya. The rule, of course, refers to other castes also, and to those cases where no periodical interest is taken, but the loan returned in kind.
