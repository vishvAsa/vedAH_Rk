40. A Brāhmaṇa and a Kṣatriya shall not lend (anything at interest acting like) usurers. [^22] 


[^22]:  Manu X, 117. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita reads with MS. B., vārdhushiṃ na dadyātām, and explains it by vṛddhiṃ naiva prayojayetām, 'they shall not take interest.' I read with the other MSS. vārdhuṣī, and translate that term by 'usurers.' Below, Sūtra 42, vārdhushi is used likewise in this its usual sense.
