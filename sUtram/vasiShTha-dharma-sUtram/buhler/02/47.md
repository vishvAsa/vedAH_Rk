47. (They may lend) what is sold by weight, (taking) eight times (the original value on repayment). [^25] 


[^25]:  The Ratnākara quoted by Colebrooke loc. cit. takes 'what is sold by weight' to be 'camphor and the like.' Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita thinks that 'clarified butter, honey, spirituous liquor, oil, molasses, and salt' are meant. But most of these substances fall under the term rasāḥ, 'flavouring substances.' The proper explanation of the words seems to be, 'any other substance not included among those mentioned previously, which is sold by weight.'
