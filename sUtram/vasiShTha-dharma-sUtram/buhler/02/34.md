34. The plough is attended by strong males, provided with a useful share and with a handle (to be held) by the drinker of Soma; that raises (for him) a cow, a sheep, a stout damsel, and a swift horse for the chariot. [^20] 


[^20]:  Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā XII, 71. The translation follows the explanation given in the next Sūtra as closely as possible, though the latter is without doubt erroneous. The purpose for which Vasiṣṭha introduces it, is to show that a Vedic text permits agriculture to a Brāhmaṇa who offers Soma-sacrifices.
