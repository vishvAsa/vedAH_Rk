5. They quote also (the following passage from the Veda) to the same (effect): 'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a man learned in the Vedas, that which (resides) above the navel and the other which below (the navel) descends down-wards. Through that which (resides) above the navel, his offspring is produced, when he initiates Brāhmaṇas, when he teaches them, when he causes them to offer oblations, when he makes them holy. By that which resides below the navel the children of his body are produced. Therefore they never say, to a Śrotriya, who teaches the Veda, "Thud art destitute of offspring."' [^4] 


[^4]:  The reading tathāpyudāharanti, which several of my MSS. give, seems to me preferable to Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita's udāharati. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita explains sādhu karoti, 'makes them holy,' by adhyātmam upadiśati,' teaches them transcendental knowledge.'
