21. (Men of) all (castes) may wear their hair arranged according to the customs fixed (for their family), or allow it to hang down excepting the lock on the crown of the head. [^12] 


[^12]:  In illustration of this Sūtra Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita quotes a verse of Laugākṣi, which states that Brāhmaṇas belonging to the Vasiṣṭha family wore the top-lock on the right side of the head, and the members of the Atri family allowed it to hang down on p. 12 both sides, while the Bhṛgus shaved their heads, and the Āṅgirasas wore five locks (cūḍā) on the crown of the head. Cf. Max Müller, Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 53.
