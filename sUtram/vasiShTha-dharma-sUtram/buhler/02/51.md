51. 'Hear the interest for a money-lender declared by the words of Vasiṣṭha, five mash's for twenty (kārṣāpaṇas may be taken every month); thus the law is not violated.' [^28] 


[^28]:  Gautama XII, 29; Colebrooke I, Dig. XXIV. The rule given in this Sūtra refers, as Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita correctly states, to loans, for which security is given. The rate is 1¼ per cent for the month, or 15 per annum; see the note to Gautama loc. cit. Manu, VIII, 140, especially mentions that this rate is prescribed by Vasiṣṭha.
