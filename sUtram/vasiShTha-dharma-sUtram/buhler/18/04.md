[^2]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita reads Romaka, 'a Roman,' for Rāmaka, and the B. MS. supports him. The other MSS., including I. O. 913, give the reading adopted above. I prefer it, as there is no reason to assume that the Vāsiṣṭha Dharmaśāstra belongs to the late period when the Hindus had become aware of the existence of the Roman empire. On the other hand, it may be urged that Romaka is a correction which would easily suggest itself to a Paṇḍit, who was unable to find a parallel passage in which the word Rāmaka occurs.
