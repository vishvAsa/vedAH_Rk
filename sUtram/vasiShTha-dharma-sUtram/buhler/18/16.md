16. 'If ever a worm is produced in an open wound (on his body), he shall purify himself by the Prājāpatya penance, and give gold, a cow, (and) a garment as presents (to Brāhmaṇas).' [^9] 


[^9]:  A Prājāpatya penance, i.e. a Kṛcchra, see below, XXI, 20. p. 96 The verse belongs rather to the section on penances, and seems to have been entered here merely because it stood in Yama's text with the other two, and the author, to use a homely Indian comparison, 'did not disdain to catch a fish, though he went to fetch water.'
