17. Manu has declared that the (peculiar) laws of countries, castes, and families (may be followed) in the absence of (rules of) the revealed texts. [^12] 


[^12]:  Manu VII, 203; VIII, 41; Gautama XI, 20. Jāti,' castes,' which sometimes, and perhaps as appropriately, has been translated by 'tribes,' denotes in my opinion those numerous subdivisions of the four great varṇas, which we now find all over India, and which can be shown to have existed for a very long time. Usually the word 'caste' is also applied to them.
