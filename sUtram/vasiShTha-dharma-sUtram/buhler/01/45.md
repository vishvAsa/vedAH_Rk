45. (It is further stated in the Veda), 'The Brāhmaṇa makes the Veda rich; the Brāhmaṇa saves from misfortune; therefore the Brāhmaṇa shall not be made a source of subsistence. Soma is his king.' [^33] 


[^33]:  Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa V, 4, 2, 3. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita's division of the quotation into several Sūtras is unnecessary. His explanation of anādya, which he takes to mean 'the first of all,' is wrong. He asserts that the Brāhmaṇa is said 'to make the Veda rich,' because by sacrificing and so forth he fulfils its object and protects it. But the phrase is probably corrupt. If it is said that Soma is the king of the Brāhmaṇas, the object is to indicate that an earthly king is not their master, see Gautama XI, 1.
