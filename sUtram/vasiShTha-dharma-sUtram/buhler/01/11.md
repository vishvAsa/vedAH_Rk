11. But not different ones, (i.e. those) of (countries where) laws opposed (to those of Āryāvarta prevail). [^6] 


[^6]:  My translation follows the text given by Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita and p. 3 B., and the explanation of the former, because it seems to me that the general sense which they give, is the correct one. I feel, however, not certain that the word. pratilomakadharmāṇām, 'of those countries where opposite laws prevail,' is more than a care less correction. The majority of the MSS. read pratilomakakṣadharmāṇaḥ (kalpadharmāṇaḥ), which by itself is difficult of explanation. But, as the text of the next Sūtra contains an apparently superfluous phrase, I fear, we shall have to admit that the text is here disfigured by corruptions, which with our present MSS. it is impossible to remove with certainty.
