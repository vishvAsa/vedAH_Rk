8. The country of the Āryas (Āryāvarta) lies to the east of the region where (the river Sarasvatī) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest, to the north of the Pāripātra (mountains), to the south of the Himālaya. [^4] 


[^4]:  The region where the river Sarasvatī disappears is the Pattiālā district in the Pañjāb. The Pāripātra mountains belong to the great Vindhya range, and are probably the hills in Mālvā. The position of the Kālakavana or Black-forest is not accurately known. But it must probably be sought in Bihār. All the MSS. as well as Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita read in this Sūtra prāgādarśanāt instead of prāgadarśanāt, 'to the east of the region where the river Sarasvatī disappears.' This circumstance gains some importance by the fact that the Mahābhāṣya on Pāṇini II, 4, 10, quotes the same definition of the Āryāvarta, giving, however, instead of adarśanāt prāgādarśāt, 'to the east of Ādarśa, i.e. the Ādarśa mountains.' It seems to me not improbable that our Sūtra, too, had originally prāgādarśāt, and that some Paṇḍit who knew nothing about the Ādarśa hills, but remembered Manu II, as, and Baudhāyana I, 1, 25, where the word vinaśanāt, 'the disappearance of the Sarasvatī,' undoubtedly occurs, added the syllable na and forgot to correct the ā, after prāg.
