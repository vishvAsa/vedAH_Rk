18. Sinful men are, he who sleeps at sunrise or at sunset, he who has deformed nails or black teeth, he whose younger brother was married first, he who married before his elder brother, the husband of a younger sister married before the elder, the husband of an elder sister whose younger sister was married first, he who extinguishes the sacred fires, (and) he who forgets the Veda through neglect of the daily recitation. [^13] 


[^13]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita explains vīrahā, 'he who extinguishes the sacred fires,' by 'the destroyer of his sons or of his spiritual clients' p. 5 (yajamāna); but the rules given below, XX, 11, and XXI, 27, in the section on penances, confirm the explanation given above.
