7. (Acts sanctioned by) the sacred law (are those) for which no (worldly) cause is perceptible. [^3] 


[^3]:  The Sūtra contains a limitation of Sūtra 5. It indicates that the customs of the Śiṣṭas, for which worldly motives are perceptible, have no authority, and are not to be followed. The principle enunciated is one inculcated by the Mīmāṃsakas (P: M. S. p. 2 I, 3, 3-4). See also Āpastamba I, 1, 4, 5-10; I, 4, 12, 8; and Introduction, p. xxvii. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita has misunderstood the Sūtra. He reads, against the MSS., agṛhyamāṇakāraṇo ’dharmaḥ, 'unlawful acts are those for which no motive, i.e. no sacred source such as the Vedas, is perceptible.'
