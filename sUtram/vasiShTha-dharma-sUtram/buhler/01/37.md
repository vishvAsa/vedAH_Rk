37. (It is stated) in (the following passage of) the Cāturmāsyas, 'She (forsooth) who has been bought by her husband (commits sin, as) afterwards she unites herself with strangers.' [^28] 


[^28]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita makes a mistake by connecting the word 'cāturmāsyeshu' with the next Sūtra. He is right in saying that 'the Cāturmāsyas' is the name of a book. It is, however, not a separate work, but the kāṇḍa or section of a Vedic work treating of the Cāturmāsya sacrifices (see Max Müller, Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 355). The particular work from which our quotation has been taken, is either the Maitrāyāṇīya Saṃhitā, or the Kāṭhaka. For, as Dr. von Schroeder informs me, Maitrāyāṇīya Saṃhitā I, 10, 11 reads 'anṛtaṃ vā eṣā karoti yā patyuḥ krītā satyathānyaiś carati,' and the title of the kāṇḍa is Cāturmāsyāni. Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. V, 407, has found the same words in the Cāturmāsya section of the Kāṭhaka XXXVI, 5. In the translation I have added the beginning of the passage which Vasiṣṭha omits, according to the Maitrāyāṇīya Saṃhitā.
