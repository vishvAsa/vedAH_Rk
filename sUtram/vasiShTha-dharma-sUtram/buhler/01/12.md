12. Some (declare the country of the Āryas to be situated) between the (rivers) Gaṅgā and Yamunā. [^7] 


[^7]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita reads this Sutra 'etad āryāvartam ityācakṣate gaṅgāyamunayor antaretyeke,' and takes it as one sentence, the subject of which is 'eke.' I feel no doubt that this explanation is utterly untenable, and that the first four words have nothing to do with this Sutra, the second part of which occurs also in the Baudhāyana Dharma-sūtra I, 1, 27. My opinion is that they originally belonged to Sūtra 11, though the state of the MSS. at my disposal does not allow me to say how Sūtra 11 has to be corrected. The general sense of Sūtra 12 is, however, perfectly certain.
