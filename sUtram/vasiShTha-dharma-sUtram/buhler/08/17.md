17. A Brāhmaṇa who always carries water (in his gourd), who always wears the sacred thread, who daily recites the Veda, who avoids the food of outcasts, who approaches (his wife) in the proper season, and offers sacrifices in accordance with the [^16]  rules (of the Veda, after death) never falls from Brahman's heaven.


[^16]:  'Who always carries water (in his gourd)' (nityodakī) may also be translated, 'who always keeps water (in his house);' see Āpastamba II, 1, 1, 15. 'Who always wears the sacred thread' p. 45 may also mean 'who always wears his upper in the manner required at a sacrifice,' i.e. passes it over the left and under the right arm.
