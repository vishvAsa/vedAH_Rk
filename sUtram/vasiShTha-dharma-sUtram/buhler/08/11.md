11. (A householder) shall be industrious in reciting the Veda, offering sacrifices, begetting children, and (performing his other duties). [^11] 


[^11]:  I agree with Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita that the word 'and' used in this enumeration serves the purpose of calling to mind that there are other minor duties. The three named specially are the so-called 'three debts;' see below, XI, 48.
