5. The Mānava (Sūtra states), 'Only when he worships the manes and the gods, or honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.' [^4] 


[^4]:  Mānavam, 'the Mānava (Sūtra),' means literally 'a work proclaimed by Manu' (manunā proktam). It is probable that the work referred to by Vasiṣṭha is the lost Dharma-sūtra of the Mānava Śākhā, which is a subdivision of the Maitrāyaṇīyas, and on which the famous metrical Mānava Dharmaśāstra is based. The words of the Sūtra may either be a direct quotation or a summary of the opinion given in the Mānava-sūtra. I think the former supposition the more probable one, and believe that not only Sūtra 5, but also Sūtras 6-8 have been taken bodily from the ancient Dharma-sūtra. For Sūtra 6 agrees literally with a verse of the metrical Manusmṛti, and at the end of Sūtra 8 several MSS. have the word iti, the characteristic mark that a quotation is finished, while the language of Sūtra 8 is more antiquated than Vasiṣṭha's usual style. If my view is correct, it follows that the lost Mānava Dharma-sūtra consisted, like nearly all the known works of this class, partly of prose and partly of verse.
