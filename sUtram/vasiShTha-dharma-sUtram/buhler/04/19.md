19. Others (than the blood-relations) shall perform (the obsequies) of married females, [^13] 


[^13]:  Gautama XIV, 36; Pāraskara Gṛhya-sūtra III, xo, 42. Others than the blood-relations,' i.e. 'the husband and his relatives.' The MSS. have another Sūtra following this, which Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita leaves out. Tāśca teṣām, 'and they (the married females shall perform the obsequies) of those (i.e. their husbands and his Sapiṇḍas).' It seems to me very probable that the passage is genuine, especially as Pāraskara, Gṛhya-sūtra III, 10, 43, has the same words.
