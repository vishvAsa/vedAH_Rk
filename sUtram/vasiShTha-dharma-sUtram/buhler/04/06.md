6. 'On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.' [^5] 


[^5]:  Identical with Manu V, 41; Viṣṇu LI, 64; and Sāṅkhāyana Gṛhya-sūtra II, 16, 1. I take piṭridaivata, against Kullūka's and Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita's view, as a bahuvrīhi compound, and dissolve it by pitaro daivataṃ yaśmiṃstat, literally 'such (a rite) where the manes are the deities,' The other explanation, '(rites) p. 27 to the manes or to the gods,' which is also grammatically correct, recommends itself less, because the rites to the gods are already included by the word yajñe, 'at a sacrifice.' As to the Madhuparka, see Āpastamba II, 4, 8, 8-9, and below XI, 1.
