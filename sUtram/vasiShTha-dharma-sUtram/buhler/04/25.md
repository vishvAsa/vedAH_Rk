25. (If the second death or birth happens) on the morning (of the day on which the first period of impurity expires, they shall be purified) after three (days and nights). [^18] 


[^18]:  Viṣṇu. XXII, 37. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita explains prabhāte, 'on the morning (of the day on which the first period of impurity expires),' in accordance with Nandapaṇḍita's explanation of Viṣṇu's text by 'during the last watch (of the last night of the period of impurity).' See also the slightly different explanation of the identical swords by Haradatta, Gautama XIV, 8.
