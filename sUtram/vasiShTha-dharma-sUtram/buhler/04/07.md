7. 'Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure living beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare) the slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary sense of the word).' [^6] 


[^6]:  Manu V, 48, and Viṣṇu LI, 71, where, however, the conclusion of the verse has been altered to suit the ahiṃsā-doctrines of the compilers of the metrical Smṛtis. The reason why slaughter at a sacrifice is not slaughter in the ordinary sense may be gathered from Viṣṇu LI, 61, 63.
