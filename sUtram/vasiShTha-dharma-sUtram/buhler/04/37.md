37. When he has touched a sacrificial post, a pyre, a burial-ground, a menstruating or a lately confined woman, impure men or (Cāṇḍālas and so forth), he shall bathe, submerging both his body and his head. [^25] 


[^25]:  Viṣṇu XXII, 69. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita and MS. B. read pūya, p. 31 'pus,' instead of yūpa, 'a sacrificial post.' The reading is, however, wrong, because the parallel passages of most Smṛtis enjoin that a man who has touched a sacrificial post shall bathe. The cause of the mistake is probably a mere clerical error. The MSS. repeat the last word of this chapter, apa ityapaḥ. The reason is not, as Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita imagines, that the author wishes to indicate the necessity of bathing when one touches a person who has touched some impure thing or person. It is the universal practice of the ancient authors to repeat the last word of a chapter in order to mark its end, see ej. Gautama note on I, 61. If it is neglected in the earlier chapters of the Vāsiṣṭha Dharma-sūtra, the badness of the MSS. is the cause.
