5. (The correct view is, that) he shall perform (a penance), because it is enjoined in the revealed texts, [^2] 


[^2]:  -7. The text appears here to be corrupt. After Sūtra 5, Baudhāyana III, 10, 6 (Gautama XIX, 7), Punaḥ stomena yajeta punaḥ savanamāyāntīti vijñāyate,' It is declared in the Veda, "Let him offer a Punaḥstoma-sacrifice, (those who offer it) again come to partake of (the libations of) Soma,"' has been left out. This omission caused the insertion of the words tasmācchrutinidarśanāt [darśanāt, Bh. F.], ('because it is enjoined in the revealed texts,') at the end of Sutra 5. The proof that the sixth Sūtra of Baudhāyana has been accidentally omitted is furnished by the fact That several MSS. of Vasiṣṭha read iti ca after yo ’śvamedhena yajate (Vas. XXII, 6). This ca has no meaning, except if another Vedic passage preceded Sutra. 6. In order to escape this difficulty, Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita writes yo ’śvamedhena yajata iti, and begins the next Sūtra with iti ca, which he explains by 'moreover.'
