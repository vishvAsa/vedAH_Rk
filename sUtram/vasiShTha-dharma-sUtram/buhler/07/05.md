5. And in case the teacher dies, he shall serve the sacred fire. [^4] 


[^4]:  Viṣṇu XXVIII, 46. I agree with Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita in thinking that the apparently purposeless particle 'and,' which is used in p. 41 this Sūtra, indicates Vasiṣṭha's approval of the rules given in other Smṛtis, according to which the student, on the death of the teacher, shall serve the teacher's son, a fellow-student, or the teacher's wife, and the service of the sacred fire is the last resource only. See Viṣṇu XXVIII, 44-45; Gautama III, 7-8.
