2. Food given by a physician, a hunter, a woman of bad character, a mace-bearer, a thief, an Abhiśasta, a eunuch, (or) an outcast must not be eaten, [^1] 


[^1]:  XIV. Viṣṇu LI, 7, 10-11. Daṇḍika, 'a mace-bearer,' may mean 'a police officer' or 'a messenger.' I read with MSS. Bh. and F. shaṇḍha, 'a eunuch,' instead of śaṭha, 'a rogue,' the reading of the other MSS. and of Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita.
