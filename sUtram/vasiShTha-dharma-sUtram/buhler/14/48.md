[^33]:  Gautama XVII, 34-35; Viṣṇu LI, 28-31. I read māndhāla, 'the flying fox,' while Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita gives māghāra, a p. 75 reading which he cannot explain. The MSS. read as follows: B. E. māghāra, Bh. F. mādhāṃ, I. O. 913 (ṭiṭṭibh)āndha (naktaṃ). Haradatta on Āpastamba I, 5, 17, 33' explains plava, 'the water-hen,' to be a kind of heron, called also śakaṭabila.
