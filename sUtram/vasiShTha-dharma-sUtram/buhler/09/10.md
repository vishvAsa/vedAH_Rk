10. Kindling a fire according to the (rule of the) Śrāmaṇaka (Sūtra), he shall offer the Agnihotra. [^9] 


[^9]:  Gautama III, 27. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita and MSS. B. F. read śrāvaṇakena, and the rest āvarṇakena. I read śrāmaṇakena, 'according to the rule of the Śrāmaṇaka Sūtra,' in accordance with Gautama's text. Baudhāyana, too, uses the same word.
