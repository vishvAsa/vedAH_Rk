1. (To live according to) the rule of conduct is doubtlessly the highest duty of all men. He whose soul is defiled by vile conduct peṛṣes in this world and in the next. [^1] 


[^1]:  VI. Manu IV, 155. The word ācāra, which has been variously translated by 'conduct,' 'rule of conduct,' and 'good conduct,' includes the observance of all the various rules for every-day life, taught in the Smṛtis, and the performance of the prescribed ceremonies and rites.
