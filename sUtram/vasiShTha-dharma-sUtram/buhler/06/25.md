25. Those Brāhmaṇas can save (from evil) who are free from passion, and patient of austerities, whose ears have been filled with the texts of the Veda, who have subdued the organs of sensation and action, who have ceased to injure animated beings, and who close their hands when gifts are offered. [^18] 


[^18]:  'Close their hands,' i.e. are reluctant to accept.
