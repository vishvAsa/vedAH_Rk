5. The sacred texts do not save from sin the deceitful man who behaves deceitfully. But that Veda, two syllables of which are studied in the right manner, purifies, just as the clouds (give beneficent rain) in the month of Iṣa. [^3] 


[^3]:  Iṣa is another name for Āśvina, the month September-October. Though the rainy season, properly so called, is over in September, still heavy rain falls in many parts of India, chiefly under the influence of the beginning north-east monsoon, and is particularly important for the Rabi or winter crops. I think, therefore, that it is not advisable to take, as Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita does, yathā ishe ’bdāḥ both with the first and the second halves of the verse, and to translate, As the clouds (in general remain barren) in the month of Iṣa, even so the texts of the Veda do not save from evil the deceitful man who behaves deceitfully. But that Veda, two syllables of which have been studied in the right manner, sanctifies, just as the clouds in the month of Iṣa, (which shed a few drops of rain on the day of the Svāti conjunction, produce pearls)." 'In the right manner,' i, e, with the due observance of the rules of studentship.
