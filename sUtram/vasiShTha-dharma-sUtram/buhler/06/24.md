24. One may know that bearing grudges, envy, speaking untruths, speaking evil of Brāhmaṇas, backbiting, and cruelty are the characteristics of a Śūdra. [^17] 


[^17]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita connects brāhmaṇadūṣaṇam, translated above by 'speaking evil of Brāhmaṇas,' with śūdralakṣaṇam, and renders the two words thus, 'the characteristics of a Śūdra which degrade a Brāhmaṇa.'
