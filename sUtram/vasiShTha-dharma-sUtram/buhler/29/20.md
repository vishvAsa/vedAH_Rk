20. 'A learned man who, free from envy, follows this rule of conduct which procures endless rewards, and which through final liberation frees him from transmigration;' [^9] 


[^9]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita and MS. B. read, against the metre and sense, yogināṃ sampūritam vidvān, another reading yogināṃ saṃmatam vidvān. F. reads yonasaṃyurimaṃ vidvān. I read yo ’nasūyurimaṃ vidvān.
