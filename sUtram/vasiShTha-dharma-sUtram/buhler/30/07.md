7. 'But the offering made through the mouth of a Brāhmaṇa, which is neither spilt nor causes pain (to sentient creatures), nor assails him (who makes it), is far more excellent than an Agnihotra.' [^4] 


[^4]:  Manu VII, 84; Yājñavalkya I, 315. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita's reading, nainam adhyācate ka yaḥ, which occurs also in B., is nonsense. I read with Bh. nainamadhyāpatecca yat, and take adhyāpatet, 'assails (the giver),' in the sense of 'troubles him by causing the performance of penances, on account of mistakes committed.' Manu's version, na vinaśyati karhicit, 'and never peṛṣes,' is of course an easier one, but it seems to me doubtful whether it is older than Vasiṣṭha's.
