8. (Those who recite the Veda) proclaim the following (rule): 'Collyrium and ointment must not be accepted from her; for that is the food of women. Therefore they feel a loathing for her (while she is) in that (condition, saying), "She shall not approach."' [^8] 


[^8]:  Taitt. Sarah. II, 5, 1, 6. I read the text of this Sūtra as follows: 'Tadāhuḥ--añjanābhyañjanam evāsyā na pratigrāhyaṃ taddhi striyā annam iti--tasmāt tasyai ca tatra ca bībhatsante meyam upāgād iti.' The MSS. give the following readings in the second clause: tasmāt tasmai ca (B. Bh. E. F,), tatra na (F.), medhamupāgād (Bh. F.), medha upāgād (E.), seyamupāgād (B.) Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita follows as usually MS. B. His explanation of the whole Sūtra is erroneous. 'That is the food of women,' i.e. that is as necessary to women as their food, because to beautify themselves is one of their duties.
