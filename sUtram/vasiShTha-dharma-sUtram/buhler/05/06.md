6. (During that period) she shall not apply collyrium to her eyes, nor anoint (her body), nor bathe in water; she shall sleep on the ground; she shall not sleep in the day-time, nor touch the fire, nor make a rope, nor clean her teeth, nor eat meat, nor look at the planets, nor smile, nor busy herself with (house-hold affairs), nor run; she shall drink out of a large vessel, or out of her joined hands, or out of a copper vessel. [^6] 


[^6]:  Taitt. Saṃh. II, 5, I, 6-7. I read with the majority of the MSS., grahānna nirīkṣeta instead of gṛhān na nirikṣeta, which latter phrase Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita renders by 'she shall not look out of the house.' My reading is confirmed by his quotation from the Smṛtimañjarī, where grahāṇāṃ nirīkṣaṇam, 'looking at the planets, i.e. the sun, moon,' &c., is forbidden. 'A large vessel,' i.e. an earthen jar.--Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita.
