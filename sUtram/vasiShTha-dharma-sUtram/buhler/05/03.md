3. The penance (to be performed) by a (wife) for being unfaithful to her husband has been declared in the (section on) secret penances. [^3] 


[^3]:  'The penance which has been ordained in case a wife is unfaithful to her husband, i.e. goes to a lover and so forth, must be performed in secret, i.e. in solitary places.'--Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita. The explanation is clearly erroneous. Rahasyeshu cannot mean 'in secret' or 'in secret places.' It might refer either to a. work or works called Rahasyāni or to the rahasyāni prāyaścittāni. As p. 32 the next Sūtra contains a half-verse taken from the section on secret penances, XXVIII, 4, it is evident that Vasiṣṭha here makes a cross-reference. Similar cross-references occur further on.
