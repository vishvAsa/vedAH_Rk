7. For it has been declared in the Veda, 'When Indra had slain (Vṛtra) the three-headed son of Tvaṣṭṛ, he was seized by Sin, and he considered himself to be tainted with exceedingly great guilt. All beings cried out against him (saying to him), [^7]  'O thou slayer of a learned Brāhmaṇa! O thou slayer of a learned Brāhmaṇa!' He ran to the women for protection (and said to them), 'Take upon yourselves the third part of this my guilt (caused by) the murder of a learned Brāhmaṇa.' They answered, ''What shall we have (for doing thy wish)?' He replied, 'Choose a boon.' They said, 'Let us obtain offspring (if our husbands approach us) during the proper season, at pleasure let us dwell (with our husbands until (our children) are born.' He answered, 'So be it.' (Then) they took upon themselves (the third part of his guilt). That guilt of Brāhmaṇa-murder appears every month as the menstrual flow. Therefore let him not eat the food of a woman in her courses; (for) such a one has put on the shape of the guilt of Brāhmaṇa-murder.


[^7]:  Taitt. Sarah. II, 5, I, 2-5. The name 'slayer of a learned Brāhmaṇa' is applied to Indra, because Vṛtra is said to have been deeply versed in the Vedas. Regarding the 'proper season of women,' see Manu III, 46-48. In the clause 'That guilt of Brāhmaṇa-murder appears,' &c., I read āvir bhavati with the majority of the MSS. For the prohibition to accept food from a-rajasvalā, see Viṣṇu LI, 16-17.
