9. 'Those (Brāhmaṇas in) whose (houses) menstruating women sit, those who keep no sacred fire, [^9]  and those in whose family there is no Śrotriya; all these are equal to Śūdras.'


[^9]:  The meaning of the Sūtra is that a Brāhmanical beggar must not accept any alms from Brāhmaṇas whose wives are in their p. 34 courses, who keep no sacred fire, and do not attend to the duty of Veda-study. Regarding sinners of the latter two kinds, see also Āpastamba I, 6, 18, 32-33.
