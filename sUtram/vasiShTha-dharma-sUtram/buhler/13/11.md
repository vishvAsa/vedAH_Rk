11. In towns where a corpse (lies) or Cāṇḍālas (stay). [^6] 


[^6]:  Gautama XVI, 19; Viṣṇu XXX, 10. The above translation follows Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita's gloss. But the Sūtra may also be taken differently: 'In (villages) where a corpse lies or a Cāṇḍāla stays (and) in towns.' For the prohibition to study in towns is mentioned by Gautama XVI, 45; Manu IV, 116; and Āpastamba I, 3, 9, 4.
