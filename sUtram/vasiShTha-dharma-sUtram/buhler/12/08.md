8. Let him not be a stay-at-home. [^7] 


[^7]:  Gautama IX, 53. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita gives besides the above interpretation of the Sūtra from Haradatta's Gautamīyā Mitākṣarā, another one, according to which it means, 'Let him not forsake his own family and enter another one (by adoption and so forth).' A third p. 60 explanation is given by Nārāyaṇa on Sāṅkhāyana Gṛhya-sūtra IV, 12, II, who takes it to mean, 'Let him not go from one house to the other.'
