5. Let him not dwell together with a person whose clothes are foul; [^5] 


[^5]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, whom I have followed in the translation of this Sūtra, thinks that it indicates the obligation of wearing clean clothes, see e.g. Viṣṇu LXXI, 9. It seems to me, however, probable that its real sense is, 'Let him not cohabit with a woman during her courses,' and that the next Sūtra has to be read nārajasvalayā., 'Nor with one of immature age.'
