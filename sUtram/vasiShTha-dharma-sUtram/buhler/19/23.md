23. A Śrotriya is free from taxes, (and so are) a servant of the king, one who has no protector, [^16]  one who has left (the order of householders), an infant, a very aged man, a young man (who studies), and pradātās;


[^16]:  Āpastamba II, 10, 26, 10, 12-17; Manu VIII, 394. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita to correctly points out that, though according to I, 43, all Brāhmaṇas are to be free from taxes, the Śrotriya or Vaidik is mentioned once more in order to show that a king, however distressed, must not take anything from him (Manu VII, 133). Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita reads instead of pradātās, pradātāraḥ, 'very liberal men.' Manu loc. cit. exempts 'those who confer great benefits on priests of eminent learning' from paying taxes. His emendation would, therefore, be acceptable if the word pradātāḥ did not occur in the same connexion above, XI, 7.
