37. Now they quote also a verse proclaimed by Manu, which refers to duties and. taxes, 'No duty (is paid) on a sum less than a Karṣāpaṇa, there is no tax on a livelihood gained by art, nor on an infant, nor on a messenger, nor on what has been received as alms, nor on the remnants of property left after a robbery, nor on a Śrotriya, nor on an ascetic, nor on a sacrifice.' [^24] 


[^24]:  I translate the one word śulka by 'duties and taxes.' The term has a great many different meanings in the law books, and is in this verse apparently used in two senses. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita is of a different opinion, and thinks that the persons named are free from paying a śulka in case they trade. The chief objection is that trading ascetics and Śrotriyas are not known to the ancient writers, though they are common enough in modern India.
