29. And when a king has died, let him give what is required for the occasion. [^21] 


[^21]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita refers this and the following five Sūtras to p. 100 the case where a king has conquered a foreign country; compare also Viṣṇu III, 49-48. I think that Sūtras 30-31 conclusively show that these rules are intended to regulate the conduct of a king on the death of his predecessor and his own accession to the throne.
