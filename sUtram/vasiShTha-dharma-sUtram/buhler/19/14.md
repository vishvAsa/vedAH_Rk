14. Let him not take property for his own use from (the inhabitants of) his realm. [^11] 


[^11]:  -15. The translation of these two Sutras is not certain, because the words nīhāra and naihārika are not found elsewhere in the sense which has been attributed to them here. Still I think it very probable that Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita's explanation nirhāra and nirhāre sādhu is right, and that the king is exhorted not to take the property of his subjects by force, but to levy taxes according to the value or the measure of the articles sold.
