26. No taxes (shall be paid) on the usufruct of rivers, dry grass, forests, (places of) combustion, and mountains; [^19] 


[^19]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita explains dāha, '(places of) combustion,' by agni, 'fire.' I am not certain what he means thereby. To me it seems most probable that Vasiṣṭha intends 'a place of cremation' (dāhasthala), though it is just possible to refer the expression to the jungle fires, which the aboriginal tribes light in the forests, in order to sow their Nāglī in the ground manured by the ashes.
