22. A ferry shall be taken away (from a river) in which there is no water. [^15] 


[^15]:  The meaning of the SÅ«tra seems to be, that on those rivers, where the water either runs off or is very low during the dry season, the ferrymen must not be allowed to exact a toll from people crossing without their help. Such a rule would not be superfluous, as most Indian rivers are perfectly fordable between December and June, but impassable without boats in the other five months.
