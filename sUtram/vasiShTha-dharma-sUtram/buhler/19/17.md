17. On the march against the enemy the army which consists of companies of ten, shall be able to perform a double (duty). [^13] 


[^13]:  'The army which consists of companies of ten,' i.e. the lowest subdivision of which consists of ten parts, viz. one elephant, one chariot, two horsemen, and three foot soldiers. Such a body is called a patti. The larger divisions, like the senāmukha, 'battalion,' &c., are formed by three, nine, or twenty-seven pattis. Though I am unable to adduce any positive proof for it, vāha must, according to the connexion in which it stands, be a synonym of patti. 'The double duty' of the army is, according to Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, marching and fighting.
