9. But punishment must be awarded in cases of assault and abuse after (due consideration of) the particular place and time (where and when the offence was committed), of the duties, age, learning (of the parties), and the seat (of the injury), [^7] 


[^7]:  Gautama XII, 51. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita has two Sūtras instead of one, and reads the second hiṃsākrośayoḥ kalpaḥ. The majority of the MSS. have, however, kalpā(ḥ), which I consider to be a mistake for kalpyaḥ, 'must be awarded.'
