30. If he has swallowed the flesh of a dog, a cock, a village pig, a grey heron, a vulture, a Bhāsa, a pigeon, a man, a crow or an owl, (he must) fast during seven days, (and thus) empty his entrails (afterwards he must) eat clarified butter, and be initiated again. [^21] 


[^21]:  Viṣṇu LI, 3-4; Gautama XXIII, 4-5; Manu XI, 157. The Sūtra is badly corrupted in Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita's edition. I read kaṅka instead of vaṅka, leave out vāyasa after bhāsa, and change kākolūkānāṃ sādane to kākolūkamāṃsādane. The latter change is absolutely necessary; firstly, because the penances for killing dogs and men have been given above; secondly, because the word mānuṣa requires a noun which it qualifies at the end of the compound; thirdly, because the penance which is prescribed, fasting until the entrails are empty, is absurd for murder, but appropriate for eating forbidden food; and fourthly, because the parallel passages of other Smṛtis actually do prescribe it for eating the flesh of excessively impure animals and for cannibalism. The change of amā to ānā is a very common mistake in Devanāgarī MSS.
