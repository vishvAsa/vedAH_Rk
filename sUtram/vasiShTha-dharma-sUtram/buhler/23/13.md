13. It is declared in the Veda, than honey given without asking does not defile (a student) of the Vājasaneyi-śākhā. [^11] 


[^11]:  This Sūtra may also mean, 'It is declared that, according to the Vājasaneyaka, honey given (to a student). without his asking for it does not defile him.' But a parallel passage of Devala, which Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita quotes, makes, I think, the version given above appear preferable. In either case the passage is explained by the fact that, according to the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa, Śvetaketu, one of the great teachers of the White Yajur-veda, strongly pleaded for the use of honey; see Weber, Indische Studien X, 123 seq.
