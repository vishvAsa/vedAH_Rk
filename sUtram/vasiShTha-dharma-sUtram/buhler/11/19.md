19. Let him avoid men neglecting their duties, [^16]  those afflicted with white leprosy, eunuchs, blind men, those who have black teeth, those who suffer from black leprosy, (and) those who have deformed nails.


[^16]:  Gautama XV, 16, 18. The explanation of the word nagna, p. 52 'neglecting their duties,' is doubtful. I have followed Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, who quotes the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa in support of his view. The word occurs in the same connexion, Viṣṇu LXXXII, 27, where it is rendered by 'naked.' Possibly it may refer to ascetics who go entirely naked.
