26. 'Therefore let him not offer it (to the Brāhmaṇas) without holding (a spoon) in his hand; or let him stand, holding the dish (with both hands, until) leavings of both kinds (have been produced).' [^22] 


[^22]:  Manu III, 224. The meaning of the last clause seems to be that the sacrificer shall stand before the Brāhmaṇas until they have done eating.
