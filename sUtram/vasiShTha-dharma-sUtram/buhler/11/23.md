23. 'Manu declares that both the remainder (in the vessels) and the fragments (of the meal) certainly are the portion of those members of the family who died before receiving the sacraments.' [^20] 


[^20]:  -24. Viṣṇu LXXXII, 22 Manu III, 245-246. These rules, however, do not fully agree with the teaching of our Manu-smṛti, as the latter assigns the fragments on the ground to honest and upright servants. Sūtra 24 I read with the majority of the MSS. 'lepanodakam' for 'lepamodakam,' and 'annaṃ preteshu' for 'anupreteshu.'
