7. (Thereafter) the maidens, the infants, the aged, the half-grown members of his family, and pradātās, [^6] 


[^6]:  Viṣṇu LXVII, 39. The majority of the MSS. read bālavṛddhataruṇapradātās [tato]. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita corrects the last word to pradātā, while the editor of the Calcutta edition writes prabhritīṃs [tato]. Both conjectures are inadmissible. As the same phrase occurs once more, below, XIX., 23 (where Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita writes pradātāraḥ), I think that it is not permissible to change the text. Pradātāḥ must be the correct reading, and a technical name for a class of female relatives. Etymologically it may mean 'those who have been perfectly cleansed.' But I am unable to trace its precise technical import, and have left it untranslated.
