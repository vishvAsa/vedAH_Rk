48. For it is declared in the Veda, 'A Brāhmaṇa is born, loaded with three debts,' (and further, 'He owes) sacrifices to the gods, a son to the manes, the study of the Veda to the Ṛṣis; therefore he is free from debt who has offered sacrifices, who has begotten a son, and who has lived as a student (with a teacher).' [^38] 


[^38]:  Taitt. Saṃh. VI, 3, 10, 5; Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa I, 7, 2, 11.
