27. 'He shall feed two (Brāhmaṇas) at the offering to the gods, and three at the offering to the manes, or a single man on either occasion; even a very wealthy man shall not be anxious (to entertain) a large company.' [^23] 


[^23]:  Identical with Manu III, 125; see also Viṣṇu LXXIII, 3. The offering to the gods is the Vaiśvadeva offering which precedes the Śrāddha.
