41. 'The ancestors always rejoice at a descendant who lengthens the line, who is zealous in performing funeral sacrifices, and who is rich in (images of the) gods and (virtuous) Brāhmaṇa (guests).' [^31] 


[^31]:  'Who lengthens the line,' i.e. who himself begets sons. Read instead of nuyantaṃ pitṛkarmaṇi (v. l. muyantaṃ and tṛpantaḥ), 'udyataṃ.'
