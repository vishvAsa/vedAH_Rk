5. He who properly reasons regarding an offence, in accordance with the sum of the science of the first two castes, is equitable towards all created beings. [^4] 


[^4]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita wrongly divides this Sūtra into two, and wrongly adopts the reading of MSS. B. and E., consequently he obtains a sense only by the most astonishing tricks of interpretation. I read with MSS. Bh. and F., yathāsanam aparādhohyādyavarṇayor vidyāntataḥ, to which the reading of I. O. 913 ādyavarṇayor vidhānataḥ points also. The meaning of the expression, 'according to the sum of the science of the first two castes,' I take to be according to the rules of sacred learning and of the mīmāṃsā, which is peculiar to the Brāhmaṇas and of logic (ānvīkṣikī) and polity (daṇḍanīti), which are peculiar to or at least recommended to the particular attention of the Kṣatriyas.
