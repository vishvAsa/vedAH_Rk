36. Those who give partial evidence in a judicial proceeding for the sake of a relative or for money, deprive the ancestors of their spiritual family and those of their natural family of their place in heaven. [^25] 


[^25]:  This verse, too, is corrupt, though the general sense is not doubtful. I read svajanasyārthe yadi vārthahetoḥ pakṣāśrayeṇaiva vadanti kāryam--te śabdavaṃśasya kulasya pūrvān svargasthitāṃstānapi pātayanti. 'The ancestors of their spiritual family,' i.e. the teacher, the teacher's teacher, and so forth.
