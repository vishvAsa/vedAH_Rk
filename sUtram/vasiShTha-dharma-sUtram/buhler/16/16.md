16. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Property inherited from a father, a thing bought, a pledge, property given to a wife after marriage by her husband's family, a gift, property obtained for performing a sacrifice, the property of reunited coparceners, and wages as the eighth.' [^13] 


[^13]:  In translating anvādheya by 'property given to a wife by her husband or his family after marriage,' I have followed Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita's explanation. It may, however, mean also 'a deposit to be delivered to a third person' (anvāhita or anvādhi). Pratigraha, 'a gift,' is elsewhere explained as 'property promised, but not actually given.'
