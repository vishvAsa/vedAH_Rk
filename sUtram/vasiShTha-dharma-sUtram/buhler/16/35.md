35. (Men) may speak an untruth at the time of marriage, during dalliance, when their lives are in danger or the loss of their whole property is imminent, and for the sake of a Brāhmaṇa; they declare that an untruth spoken in these five cases does not make (the speaker) an outcast. [^24] 


[^24]:  Gautama XXIII, 29. Between this and the preceding Sūtras the MSS. as well as Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita insert another one, which is so corrupt that I am unable to translate it. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita's explanation is opposed to all rules of interpretation, and not worth giving.
