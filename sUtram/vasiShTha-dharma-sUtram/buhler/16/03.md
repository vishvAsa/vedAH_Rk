3. When two (parties) have a dispute, let him not be partial to one of them. [^2] 


[^2]:  Translated as above the Sūtra is nearly equivalent to Gautama p. 79 XI, 5. But the phrase 'when two parties have a dispute' may also indicate, as Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita suggests, that the king or judge shall not promote litigation, see Gautama XIII, 27. As Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita states, the Sūtra may, however, mean also, 'when one case is being argued, let him not begin another (without finishing the first);' see Manu VIII, 43. Owing to the particular nature of the Sūtra style and the inclination of the Brāhmanical mind to double-entendres, I do not think it improbable that the author may have intended, both in this and in the preceding Sūtras, that his words should be interpreted in two ways.
