6. And let him protect what has been gained; [^5] 


[^5]:  I read with MSS. Bh. and F., saṃpannaṃ ca rakṣayet. I consider this Sūtra to contain an admonition addressed to the king for himself; see Manu VII, 99. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita and B. read sapattraṃ ca rakṣayet, 'Let him protect that which is attested by writings,' i, e. the donations of former kings, attested by writings; see Viṣṇu III, 83.
