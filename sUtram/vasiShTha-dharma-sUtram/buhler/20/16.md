16. If he has had intercourse with a female (who is considered) venerable in the family, with a female friend, with the female friend of a Guru, with an Apapātra female, or with an outcast, he shall perform a Kṛcchra penance during three months. [^12] 


[^12]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita explains sakhīm, 'a female friend,' by 'a woman who has affection (for the offender), i.e. a sister and so forth.' Apapātra are low-caste people, whose vessels must not be used; see Āpastamba I, 1, 3, 25, note.
