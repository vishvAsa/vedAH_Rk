29. 'A sin which is openly proclaimed becomes smaller.' [^22] 


[^22]:  Taken by itself the Sūtra would seem to refer to the maxim that a free confession reduces the guilt of the offender (Manu XI, 228). But on account of the next Sūtra it is necessary to assume, with Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, that half the guilt of a crime, of which another man justly accuses an offender, falls on the accuser, while the p. 107 offender's guilt becomes less by the publication of his misdeed. It is, however, not improbable that the text is here defective, and one or several Sūtras have been left out.
