24. 'For embryos (the sex of) which is unknown [^18]  become males; therefore they offer burnt-oblations for the production of males.'


[^18]:  'Therefore they offer burnt-oblations for the production of males,' i.e. they perform the Puṃsavana, one of the sacraments; p. 107 see ej. Āśvalāyana I, 13. The Sūtra is marked as a quotation, and probably belongs to some Vedic work.
