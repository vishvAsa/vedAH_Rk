41. If a man has stolen gold belonging to a Brāhmaṇa, he shall run, with flying hair, to the king, (exclaiming) 'Ho, I am a thief; sir, punish me!' The king shall give him a weapon made of Udumbara wood; with that he shall kill himself. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure after death. [^30] 


[^30]:  Viṣṇu LII, 1-2. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita remarks that Śūlapāṇi explains audumbaram, 'made of Udumbara wood,' by 'made of copper,' and that the weapon intended is a club. The last remark is probably true, as the parallel passages of the other Smṛtis state that the thief is to take a club to the king, with which he is to be struck.
