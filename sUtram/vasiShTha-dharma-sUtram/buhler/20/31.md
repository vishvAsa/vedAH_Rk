31. In like manner having slain a Kṣatriya, he shall perform (a penance) during eight years, [^24] 


[^24]:  Viṣṇu L, 12. The text is here evidently defective. The Sutra or Sūtras left out must have contained the description of another penance for the murder of a Brāhmaṇa, which is mentioned in nearly all the Smṛtis (see Viṣṇu L, 1-6, 15, and the parallel passages). Its chief conditions are, that the murderer is to live separate for twelve years, and to subsist on alms given by people who are acquainted with his crime. Without such an additional rule this and the following Sūtras are utterly unintelligible.
