23. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Through killing a spotted deer, a he-goat, and [^13]  a bird three maladies (befal men), viz. jealousy, hunger, and old age; (therefore) let him (who is guilty of such an offence) perform (a penance) during ninety-eight (days).'


[^13]:  The above translation follows the commentary of Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, p. 114 who further states that the penance to be performed shall consist of a diet of barley gruel. I feel by no means certain that his interpretation, especially that of the last clause, is correct. Possibly aṣṭānavatim āharet may mean 'he shall offer ninety-eight oblations.'
