11. That woman of the Brāhmaṇa caste who drinks spirituous liquor, the gods will not admit (after death) to the same abode with her husband; losing all spiritual merit she wanders about in this world and is born again as a leech or a pearl-oyster. [^5] 


[^5]:  Colebrooke IV, Dig. CXIII, where śūkarī, 'a sow,' is read instead of śuktikā, 'a pearl-oyster.'
