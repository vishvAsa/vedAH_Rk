33. Ascetics, (offending in the same manner) as hermits, shall perform for a protracted period (the vow of regulating the quantity of their food according to) the growth of the moon, and shall again be initiated, in accordance with (the rules of) the Institutes applicable to them. [^21] 


[^21]:  The penance prescribed appears to be similar to the Cāndrāyaṇa. The offender must eat one mouthful on the first lunar day, two on the second, and so forth. But it is not clear for how long a period the rule is to be observed. The Sūtra is interesting as it furnishes corroborative evidence for Pāṇini's statement (IV, 3, 110) that Bhikṣu-sūtras which contained the, rules applicable to Bhikṣus formerly existed.
