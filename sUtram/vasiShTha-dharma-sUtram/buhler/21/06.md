6. If (a wife) has been mentally unfaithful to her husband, she shall live on barley or rice boiled in milk during three days, and sleep on the bare ground. After the three days (have expired), the (husband) shall offer eight hundred burnt-oblations, (reciting) the Sāvitrī (and the Mantra called) Śiras, while she is immersed in water. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby). [^2] 


[^2]:  'Afterwards in order to purify her who is immersed in water, i.e. has plunged into water, he shall offer eight hundred, i.e. (such) p. 111 a number of burnt-oblations with the Śiras, i.e. (the words) "Om, ye waters, who are splendour, juice, and ambrosia," &c., which are joined to the Gāyatrī.'--Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita. The Śiras, or 'head,' is again mentioned below, XXV, 13; see also Viṣṇu LV, 9. This and the following two rules refer to offences committed with males of equal caste.
