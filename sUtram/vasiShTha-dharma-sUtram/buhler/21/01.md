1. If a Śūdra approaches a female of the Brāhmaṇa caste, (the king) shall cause the Śūdra to be tied up in Vīraṇa grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brāhmaṇī to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a black donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared that she becomes pure (thereby). [^1] 


[^1]:  -5. XXI. Gautama XXIII, 15. Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita reads, instead of prāsyet, 'he shall throw,' prāśyet, and explains it by dāhayet, he shall cause to be burnt.' It must be understood that these p. 110 extreme punishments are to be inflicted in particularly bad cases only.
