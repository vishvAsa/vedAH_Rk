10. Provided he be not engaged in (rites) procuring prosperity. [^9] 


[^9]:  'Rites procuring prosperity,' i.e. Śrāddhas, expiatory rites, &c. See also above, III, 71, and Gautama XI, 17. According to Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita the estate is in this case to be divided equally between the legitimate son and the adopted son. An entirely p. 77 different explanation, 'Provided (the estate) may not have been expended in acts of merit,' is given Dattakacandrikā V, 17-18. It is doubtlessly erroneous, for 'the estate' is nowhere mentioned in the preceding Sūtras.
