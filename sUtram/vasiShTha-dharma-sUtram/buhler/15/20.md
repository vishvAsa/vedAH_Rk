20. Having filled a golden or an earthen vessel (with water taken) from a sacred lake or river, they pour (the water) over him, (reciting the three verses) 'Ye waters are' &c. [^15] 


[^15]:  Gautama XX, 10-14. I read 'puṇyahradāt,' instead of 'pūrṇāhradāt,' as the MSS. and Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita have. The passage of the Veda referred to occurs Rig-veda X, 9, I.
