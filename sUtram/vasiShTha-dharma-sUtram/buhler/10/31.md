31. A Brāhmaṇa who wears the sacred thread, who holds in his hand a gourd filled with water, who is pure and avoids the food of Śūdras will not fail (to gain) the world of Brahman. [^20] 


[^20]:  Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita believes that this Sūtra again refers to ascetics. But that is hardly possible, as ascetics are not allowed to wear a sacrificial thread (see above. Sūtra 18). I think that it is meant to emphatically assert that a Brāhmaṇa who is free from the shortcomings enumerated in the preceding Sūtra, and who follows the rule of conduct, will obtain salvation, whether he passes through the order of Saṃnyāsins or not.
