27. Let him not be crooked (in his ways); (let him) not (observe the rules of) impurity on account [^18]  of deaths (or births); let him not have a house; let him be of concentrated mind.


[^18]:  The text is here probably corrupt. But I follow Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita. Several MSS. read aśaṭho, 'he shall not be a rogue,' for aśavo, 'he shall not observe the rules of impurity.'
