23. 'But he, forsooth, knows (the' road to) salvation who cares neither for a hut, nor for water, nor for clothes, nor for the three Pushkaras' (holy tanks), nor for a house, nor for a seat, nor for food.' [^15] 


[^15]:  There are three Tīrthas called Pushkara; see Professor Jolly's note on Viṣṇu LXXXV, I.
